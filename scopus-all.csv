The crop, however, faces threats from a variety of leaf diseases, leading to substantial reduction in yield. Prompt and precise identification of these diseases is essential for implementing effective countermeasures and maintaining adequate food supply. Recently, deep learning methodologies have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image-based recognition and classification, including the diagnosis of plant diseases. The objective of this research is to construct a dependable cassava leaf disease identification system utilizing deep learning approaches, with an emphasis on achieving exceptional accuracy and dependability. We assess the performance of multiple cutting-edge deep learning architectures, such as ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, NasNetLarge, and EfficientNet-V2, in the context of cassava leaf disease classification. The dataset is comprised of nearly 15,000 test images, accompanied by image_id and label data in train.csv and sample_submission.csv files. Data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, is conducted before partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets. Our findings indicate that the EfficientNet-V2 model surpasses its counterparts in performance, attaining the highest validation accuracy of 0.7480 and a comparatively low validation loss of 0.7488. We further explore several strategies to enhance model performance, such as optimizing hyperparameters, employing data augmentation, utilizing early stopping, implementing learning rate scheduling, applying transfer learning, and adopting ensemble techniques. The resulting classifier offers potential benefits to farmers and agricultural specialists in making informed decisions regarding cassava leaf disease management, ultimately leading to improved crop yields and food security. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","countermeasures; Food security; identification; leaf diseases; reduction in yield","Crops; Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; % reductions; Countermeasure; Disease classification; Food security; Identification; Image-based; Leaf disease; Performance; Reduction in yield; Substantial reduction; Food supply","","","","","","","Anitha J., Saranya N., Cassava leaf disease identification and detection using deep learning approach, Int.

Therefore, diagnosing plant illnesses as early as possible is essential to prevent significant crop damage. However, an incorrect diagnosis of the condition leads to the wrong application of pesticides. To improve the quality and quantity of production, a deep learning (DL)-based method is developed for detecting and classifying plant diseases using various datasets. Plant diseases are significant determinants of plant output and quality. By utilizing digital image processing, plant diseases and pests may be identified. In recent years, DL has achieved significant advances in digital image processing, far outperforming conventional approaches. Image acquisition is the first step in computer vision-based systems. Next, different image-processing tasks, such as scaling, filtering, segmentation, selection, and feature extraction, are performed. Finally, machine learning (ML) or DL-based algorithms are used for recognition and classification. How to employ DL technology to investigate the identification of plant diseases and pests has become a major worry for academics. This chapter defines the plant disease and pest detection challenge and compares it to conventional plant disease and pest detection techniques. This chapter examines the research on plant disease and pest detection based on DL in recent years from the three perspectives of classification network, detection network, and segmentation network and summarizes the merits and disadvantages of each technique. This chapter explores potential obstacles in practical implementations of DL-based plant disease and pest detection. In addition, potential remediesand research ideas for the issues are suggested, and numerous proposals are made. This chapter concludes with an analysis and forecast of the future trend of DL-based plant disease and pest detection. © 2025 Apple Academic Press, Inc.

Early disease detection is crucial to ensuring healthy rice production. In order to address the issue of diagnosing illnesses in rice plants, a number of strategies have been put forth; nevertheless, it has been discovered from the literature that these models do not perform with the anticipated accuracy. In this study, the best fit model among four CNN deep learning algorithms for categorizing rice leaf illnesses was attempted. Patterns were divided into four groups using 1600 images: healthy, brown spot, hippa, and life burst. Based on the findings, the learning rate, accuracy, and disease recognition accuracy of the performance comparison were examined. ResNet50, VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet152, CNN deep learning models, obtained disease recognition accuracies of 75.76%, 87.64%, 96.46%, and 98.36%, respectively. The classification efficiency result demonstrates that ResNet152V2 is the best CNN model for classifying diseases affecting rice. © 2024, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

The existing deep learning crop disease recognition methods require a large number of labeled images for training, limiting the implementation of large-scale detection. To overcome this limitation, this study explores the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) in plant disease recognition. We propose a new model that combines a masked autoencoder (MAE) and a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to alleviate the harsh requirements of large amounts of labeled data. The performance of the model was validated on the CCMT dataset and our collected dataset. The results show that the improved model achieves an accuracy of 95.35% and 99.61%, recall of 96.2% and 98.51%, and F1 values of 95.52% and 98.62% on the CCMT dataset and our collected dataset, respectively. Compared with ResNet50, ViT, and MAE, the accuracies on the CCMT dataset improved by 1.2%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, and the accuracy of our collected dataset improved by 1.3%, 1.6%, and 0.6%, respectively. Through experiments on 21 leaf diseases (early blight, late blight, leaf blight, leaf spot, etc.) of five crops, namely, potato, maize, tomato, cashew, and cassava, our model achieved accurate and rapid detection of plant disease categories. This study provides a reference for research work and engineering applications in crop disease detection. © 2024 by the authors.","attention mechanism; deep learning; masked autoencoder; plant disease recognition; self-supervised learning","","","","","","Key R&D Projects in Shanxi Province, (202202140601021)","This research was funded by Key R&D Projects in Shanxi Province, grant number 202202140601021.","Nigam S., Jain R., Plant disease identification using Deep Learning: A review, Indian J.

However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily relies on the availability of large-scale manually labeled datasets, which present technical and economic challenges. Few-shot learning methods can be generalized to new categories with a small number of samples, which is very promising in the field of plant disease recognition despite the limited sample size. However, due to the complexity of real-life scenarios, distribution of disease leaves, and significant intra-class variability and inter-class similarity resulting from crop species and disease species, existing methods perform poorly in the field of plant disease recognition. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an improved multi-scale attention fusion with discriminative enhancement deep nearest neighbor neural network MAFDE-DN4 based on DN4. Our approach makes three main contributions. First, we have designed a bidirectional weighted feature fusion module (BWFM) to enhance the aggregation of fine-grained features and enhance the network's representation of complex disease images. Second, to tackle the issue of sparse feature descriptors being vulnerable to irrelevant noise in small sample conditions, a episodic attention module (EA) has been developed to produce scene category-relevant attention maps. This effectively mitigates the influence of irrelevant background information. Finally, we introduce additional spacing between category margins to enhance the original softmax loss function, amplify the inter-class differences to reduce the intra-class distances, and add L2 regularization constraint terms to stabilize the training process. To simulate different real-world scenarios, we set up different dataset settings. Under the 1-shot task and the 5-shot task, our method achieves 57.5% and 81.41% accuracy under the within-domain strategy and 36.54% and 51.23% accuracy under the cross-domain strategy. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing related work in the field of plant disease recognition, whether it is a dataset with a single background or a field dataset with a complex background in a real scenario. MAFDE-DN4 based on Few-shot learning requires substantially less data on new categories of plant diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","BWFM structure; Disease identification; EA structure; Few-shot learning; Loss function; MAFDE-DN4","Deep neural networks; Labeled data; Bidirectional weighted feature fusion module structure; Disease identification; Episodic attention module structure; Features fusions; Few-shot learning; Fusion modules; Loss functions; MAFDE-DN4; Module structure; Weighted features; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; classification; complexity; disease; identification method; pattern recognition; plant community; Zero-shot learning","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0126100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62476251, 61605173, 61403346, 32071895); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2019YFE0126100 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61605173 ),( 61403346 ) and ( 32071895 ).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFE0126100); National Natural Science Foundation of China (62476251), (61605173), (61403346) and (32071895).","Argueso D., Picon A., Irusta U., Medela A., San-Emeterio M.G., Bereciartua A., Alvarez-Gila A., Few-shot learning approach for plant disease classification using images taken in the field, Comput.

The lack of trace elements in nutrient solutions has caused huge losses to the lettuce industry. Non-obvious symptoms of trace element deficiency, the inconsistent size of the characteristic areas, and the difficulty of extraction in different growth stages are three key problems affecting lettuce deficiency symptom identification. In this study, a batch of cream lettuce (lactuca sativa) was planted in the plant factory, and its nutrient elements were artificially controlled. We collected images of the lettuce at different growth stages, including all nutrient elements and three nutrient-deficient groups (potassium deficiency, calcium deficiency, and magnesium deficiency), and performed feature extraction analysis on images of different defects. We used traditional algorithms (k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest) and lightweight deep-learning models (ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, andMobileNetV2) for classification, and we compared different feature extraction methods (texture features, color features, scale-invariant feature transform features). The experiment shows that, under the optimal feature extraction method (color), the random-forest recognition results are the best, with an accuracy rate of 97.6%, a precision rate of 97.9%, a recall rate of 97.4%, and an F1 score of 97.6%. The accuracies of all three deep-learning models exceed 99.5%, among which ShuffleNet is the best, with the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score above 99.8%. It also uses fewer floating-point operations per second and less time. The proposed method can quickly identify the trace elements lacking in lettuce, and it can provide technical support for the visual recognition of the disease patrol robot in the plant factory. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; feature extraction; horticulture; lettuce; machine vision; trace-element deficiency","","","","","","Sichuan Engineering Technology Center, (RX2200004133)","This research was funded by the project of Sichuan Engineering Technology Center (RX2200004133).","Guo D., Diagnosis of Several Pathological Diseases and Physiological Diseases of Citrus Using Hyperspectral Imaging, Master’s Thesis, (2016); Kim W.-S., Lee D.-H., Kim Y.-J., Machine vision-based automatic disease symptom detection of onion downy mildew, Comput.

With the increase in world population, the fruit demand has also increased. However, there are various diseases which affect the health of the grapevine leading to loss in its production. In the present study, a pre-trained and fine-tuned VGG16 model has been implemented for precise and accurate grape leaf disease identification. It is crucial to determine the health and growth of grapevines, but the use of advanced computer vision methods can speed up this process. The VGG16 model extracts deep features from the images and allows a faster and non-invasive performance evaluation. In the proposed work, the significance of grape leaf disease detection in viticulture is examined. The study implements the fine-tuned VGG16 model on a Kaggle-based dataset and examines the performance outcomes. The model's performance results have been identified in terms of accuracy and loss on different numbers of epochs. The results show that with the increase in the epoch count, the accuracy has also increased and reached 98% at epoch 25. The proposed VGG16 model for grape leaf disease recognition is a significant step forward for the viticulture sector, offering a potential approach for automating the evaluation of grape plant health. The proposed work also discusses about the training and testing loss and results that at epoch count 25, the lowest training and testing loss of 0.1466, and 0.1051 have been identified. These findings demonstrate the VGG16 model's effectiveness in identifying grape leaf diseases by demonstrating its precision and potential to improve both the effectiveness and quality of grapevine management.  © 2024 IEEE.","Deep learning; grapes leaf disease; grapevine diseases; precision agriculture; VGG16","Deep learning; Precision agriculture; Deep learning; Grape leaf disease; Grape leaves; Grapevine disease; Leaf disease; Multi-class classification; Precision Agriculture; Training and testing; VGG16; World population; Fruits","","","","","","","Padol P.B., Yadav A.A., SVM classifier based grape leaf disease detection, 2016 Conference on Advances in Signal Processing (CASP), (2016); Meunkaewjinda A., Kumsawat P., Attakitmongcol K., Srikaew A., Grape leaf disease detection from color imagery using hybrid intelligent system, 2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, (2008); Xie X., Ma Y., Liu B., He J., Li S., Wang H., A deep-learning-based real-time detector for grape leaf diseases using improved convolutional neural networks, Front.

Rice is the staple food crop in India and is attacked by 70 diseases, from which 11 are bacterial in origin. Most of the bacterial diseases are present throughout the growth cycle and can be grouped into a seedling, foliar, leaf sheath, grain, and root diseases. Some of these diseases have their characteristic visible symptoms, while for others, it is difficult to distinguish them from other diseases, insect damages or nutritional deficiencies. Furthermore, identification of pathogen strain(s) causing the diseases are mostly conducted in lab conditions with the isolation of DNA or RNA information and comparing them with the Gene bank's database. All these conventional approaches are tedious and allow little time for preventive measures. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) approaches, agricultural practices have shifted from classical to smarter farming enterprises. Amalgamating the knowledge of image processing, DL, and genomic selection (GS) results in the detection and classification of plant diseases in the field. In situations where manual inspection of the crop is not possible, these tools come in very handy. Image processing and DL tools are useful for the farmers enabling fast and efficient recognition of plant diseases. This could facilitate early preventive measures for plant diseases and improve productivity. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of current approaches used for detecting bacterial diseases and opens the potential for integrating new tools for disease detection. © 2023 Apple Academic Press, Inc.

In this paper, a RegNet-CMTL algorithm is proposed, which not only effectively improves the accuracy of cotton pest and disease identification, but also significantly reduces the false alarm rate. First, the risk of overfitting is reduced by regularizing the data enhancement method. Meanwhile, CBAM attention mechanism and multi-scale feature fusion strategy are added to enhance the feature extraction and fine-grained classification ability of the model. Finally, a migration learning strategy is applied to further optimize the overall performance and convergence speed of the model. The experimental results show that the RegNet-CMTL model improves the average recognition accuracy by 5.416% and reduces the average false alarm rate by 1.110% compared to RegNet, and compares with other convolutional neural networks such as Shufflenet, ResNet34, VGG-16, Alexnet, and Googlenet, the average recognition accuracy is improved by 25.226%, 11.064%, 3.924% and 1.742%. Therefore, the RegNet-CMTL algorithm can effectively reduce the error of mixing pest and healthy cotton during the cotton picking process, thus improving the overall quality of cotton. © 2024 IEEE.","CBAM Attentional Mechanisms; cotton; deep migratory learning; Multi-scale feature fusion; plant diseases and insect pests; RegNet","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Errors; Image resolution; Learning systems; Attentional mechanism; CBAM attentional mechanism; Deep migratory learning; False alarm rate; Features fusions; Multi-scale feature fusion; Multi-scale features; Plant diseases and insect pests; Recognition accuracy; Regnet; Cotton","","","","","Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Key Research and Development Task Special, (2022B02038)","This study was supported by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Key Research and Development Task Special (2022B02038).

Infected plants can cause significant financial losses to farmers by lowering crop yields. It is extremely desirable to detect early signs and symptoms of plant diseases in a nation like India, where agriculture supports the majority of the population. More accurate and faster plant disease detection might assist in lowering the damage. With tremendous improvements and advancements in deep learning, the effectiveness and precision of plant disease detection and identification systems may be improved. The goal of this study is to discover leaf illnesses found in tomato crops and reduce the financial losses caused by the diseases. We have implemented transfer learning using a pre-trained Squeeze Net Model to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases. Our model can automatically detect 9 types of deadly diseases that are very common in tomato crops. We have acquired 10 classes (one healthy leaf class and 9 diseased leaf classes) consisting of 16,012 tomato leaf samples from a benchmarked Plant Village dataset to train and validate the suggested method. On the public dataset, the class-wise classification precision rate varies from 77.9% to 99.6%, and the overall classification accuracy of the suggested model is observed as 93.1% which is a significant enhancement in performance over previous tomato disease detection techniques. © 2023, Bentham Science Publishers.","CNN; Deep learning; Plant disease; SqueezeNet; Tomato; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","Dhingra G., Kumar V., Joshi H.D., Study of digital image processing techniques for leaf disease detection and classification, Multimedia Tools Appl., 77, 15, pp. 19951-20000, (2018); Singh V., Misra A.K., Detection of plant leaf diseases using image segmentation and soft computing techniques, Inf.

In connection with this interest, deep learning architectures show a remarkable era in various fields of image processing and computer vision, including image classification, function detection, and image pattern recognition. In this study, we examine many aspects of convolutional neural networks for image pattern recognition. We examine the early and late fusion of multiple pattern recognition classifiers using various plant leaves. Commonly, it considers disease discovery with the diagnostic technologies available. In standard cases, planters usually do not discover the disease. Therefore, plant leaf disease detection is a significant research problem, and one of their goals is to uncover an effective way to identify leaf image disease. The article has made a potential effort to find a process that should be able to expose plant leaf disease using early and late fusion of two classifiers: modified Optimized Deep Neural Network (ODNN) with different parameters of evolutionary optimization of Grasshopper algorithm (GOA), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that could support the system to achieve excellent performance.

Timely recognition of these invaders is essential for proactive prevention measures, especially considering the potential risks they pose to human health and safety. For example, certain species may produce allergic pollen, toxic compounds or thorns that can cause skin irritation or injury to humans and animals. However, current methods rely on manual identification, which is labor-intensive and prone to misidentification due to the diversity and morphological similarities of these plants. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the efficacy of two deep learning algorithms, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0, for multi-class classification of invasive plants. Utilizing data sourced from Kaggle and images scrapped from Google, our combined dataset encompasses images of five distinct invasive plant species. Through our experiments, we found that the EfficientNetB0 model outperforms ResNet50 model, obtaining 84% accuracy. ©2024 IEEE.","CNNs; Deep learning; EfficientNetB0; Image classification; Invasive plants;

However, the major barrier to the quantity and quality of yield is crop disease. For quick and reliable recognition of various plant illnesses, it is mandatory to design a computer-aided system. Timely and accurate recognition of numerous crop leaf infections is a complicated job because of the presence of vast sample distortions like the prevalence of clutter, blur, texture, and luminance changes in samples. Moreover, the extreme resemblance between the normal and infected parts of visual samples also extends the difficulty of the identification procedure. Further, the massive differences in the size, structure, and orientation of crop leaves and infected areas also hinder the accurate recognition of various crop diseases. To deal with the listed issues, we have proposed an improved and effective deep-learning strategy namely the PlantRefineDet. Our approach comprises three steps. First, the sample annotations are created for defining the target object. Next, an improved RefineDet approach is presented that employs the ResNet-50 as its base network for extracting a set of deep features. Lastly, the one-step detector RefineDet is utilized to localize and classify numerous crop disorders. The PlantRefineDet approach improves the plant disease localization and categorization results because of its improved feature calculation ability which facilitates the reemployment of features from the previous layers and increases the recall power of the system. Also, the PlantRefineDet approach adopts an additional phase to eliminate the irrelevant anchors and better adjust the bounding box orientation to exactly locate the infected regions of plant leaves which result to improve the recognition performance of the introduced model. We have confirmed the effectiveness of our approach through extensive evaluation on a challenging PlantVillage data sample and obtained a remarkable accuracy of 99.994%. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Classification;

Convolutional neural networks are widely used in deep learning, specifically for problems related to pattern recognition and machine vision. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the numerous image processing and machine learning strategies for rice plant disease diagnosis. It does this by examining the various algorithms and machine learning techniques used to diagnose illnesses in rice plants using photographs of diseased rice plants. This study discusses several methods and offers a concise synopsis of important concepts in the fields of machine learning and image processing in relation to the classification and identification of illnesses in rice plants. This study examines and contrasts various algorithmic models and methods for classifying and identifying diseases that impact rice plants. It includes scientific results that over the last five years have been published in international review publications. In addition, this paper presents an overview and analysis of various methods used to identify agricultural illnesses, leaf health, and the image processing techniques used for the same. The framework mentioned here, can be used to more effectively detect and diagnose various rice crop diseases, which can cause the agriculture industry to experience large losses owing to rice plant diseases.

Traditional computer vision and pattern recognition technologies have limits when it comes to tackling such difficult problems. However, deep learning had gained popularity in recent years, particularly for the detection and recognition of biotic stress in diseased leaf photos of plants with varying lighting conditions, complicated backdrops, and background noise. In this paper, a system was provided that uses several “Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)” for the automatic recognition and identification of multi-biotic tomato leaf lesions collected from PlantVillage. For instance segmentation, a “Mask R-CNN” network is used in the first phase; for semantic segmentation a Hybrid Deep Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network Model (Hybrid-DSCNN) model is compared with U-Net and Seg-Net in the second phase, and a CNN model is used for classification in the third stage. The two backbone feature extractors were employed in the Mask R-CNN network, and the ResNet50 displays average precision of 73.00% in the instance segmentation test, which is superior to other models. For the segmentation and classification tasks, the Hybrid-DSCNN 2Layer-Convo-USN has achieved an accuracy of 98.25% which is better than the pre-trained models. The precision of the proposed Hybrid-DSCNN 2Layer-Convo-USN is 95.7% and of U-Net is 94.9%. The results are positive, indicating that the entire system may be implemented in any platform that can be used in the real world. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classification;

To address the issue of low accuracy in traditional deep learning networks for early crop disease identification, we propose an improved attention mechanism-based multi-fork tree network method. This method combines the attention mechanism with a residual network to recalibrate disease feature maps, resulting in SMLP_Res (Squeeze-Multi-layer Perceptron ResNet). Additionally, we extend the high-feature extraction-capable SMLP_ResNet (Squeeze-Multi-Layer Perceptron ResNet) network with a multi-fork tree structure, simplifying the task of early crop disease identification and effectively extracting early disease features. In our experiments, we use two datasets, Plant Village and AI Challenger 2018, to train and validate three network models: 18-layer ResNet, SE_ResNet, and SMLP_ResNet, as well as their equivalent multi-fork tree structure models, to assess the impact of SMLP_Res and the multi-fork tree structure on crop disease identification models. The experimental analysis shows that the three network models, 18-layer ResNet, SE_ResNet, and SMLP_ResNet, all achieve an accuracy rate of over 99% in disease identification on the Plant Village dataset, where disease features are more pronounced. However, their accuracy rates on the early disease dataset AI Challenger 2018 do not exceed 87%. SMLP_ResNet, due to the inclusion of the SMLP_Res module, provides more comprehensive feature extraction for crop disease data, resulting in better detection performance. Among the three early disease identification models with multi-fork tree structures, all models show significant improvements in accuracy on the AI Challenger 2018 dataset. The multi-fork tree SMLP_ResNet outperforms the other two models, achieving the best performance with a cherry early disease identification accuracy rate of 99.13%. The proposed multi-fork tree SMLP_ResNet crop early disease identification model simplifies the recognition task, suppresses noise transmission, and achieves high accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Crop disease identification; Deep learning; Disease classification; Early detection; Feature extraction; Microbial data intelligence; Multi-fork tree networks","","","","","","","","Abbasi R., Martinez P., Ahmad R., Crop diagnostic system: A robust disease detection and management system for leafy green crops grown in an aquaponics facility, Artif Intell Agric, 10, 1-12, (2023); Agarwal M., Gupta S.K., Biswas K.K., Development of efficient CNN model for tomato crop disease identification, Sustain Comput Inform Syst, 28, (2020); Bondad J., Harrison M.T., Whish J., Sprague S., Barry K., Integrated crop-disease models: New frontiers in systems thinking, Farm Syst, 1, 1, (2023); Das K.P., Sharma D., Satapathy B.K., Electrospun fibrous constructs towards clean and sustainable agricultural prospects: SWOT analysis and TOWS based strategy assessment, J Clean Prod, 368, (2022); de Roever C., Microbiological safety evaluations and recommendations on fresh produce, Food Control, 9, 6, pp. 321-347, (1998); Degu T., Alemu T., Desalegn A., Amsalu B., Assefa A., Association of cropping practices, cropping areas, and foliar diseases of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Ethiopia, J Agric Food Res, 14, (2023); Dutta K., Talukdar D., Bora S.S., Segmentation of unhealthy leaves in cruciferous crops for early disease detection using vegetative indices and Otsu thresholding of aerial images, Measurement, 189, (2022); Fernandez-Rios A., Laso J., Hoehn D., Amo-Setien F.J., Abajas-Bustillo R., Ortego C., Fullana-I Palmer P., Bala A., Batlle-Bayer L., Balcells M., Puig R., Aldaco R., Margallo M., A critical review of superfoods from a holistic nutritional and environmental approach, J Clean Prod, 379, (2022); Gao R., Wang R., Feng L., Li Q., Wu H., Dual-branch, efficient, channel attention-based crop disease identification, Comput Electron Agric, 190, (2021); Gavidia J.C., Chinelatto G.F., Basso M., da Ponte Souza J.P., Soltanmohammadi R., Vidal A.C., Goldstein R.H., Mohammadizadeh S., Utilizing integrated artificial intelligence for characterizing mineralogy and facies in a pre-salt carbonate reservoir, Santos Basin, Brazil, using cores, wireline logs, and multi-mineral petrophysical evaluation, Geoenergy Sci Eng, 231, (2023); Harner I., Anast J., Brehm-Stecher B., Food safety applications of genomic technologies, Reference Module in Food Science, pp. 00202-211, (2023); Holzinger A., Keiblinger K., Holub P., Zatloukal K., Muller H., AI for life: Trends in artificial intelligence for biotechnology, New Biotechnol, 74, pp. 16-24, (2023); Islam M.M., Adil M.A., Talukder M.A., Ahamed M.K., Uddin M.A., Hasan M.K., Sharmin S., Rahman M.M., Debnath S.K., DeepCrop: Deep learning-based crop disease prediction with web application, J Agric Food Res, 14, (2023); Jagadeesan B., Gerner-Smidt P., Allard M.W., Leuillet S., Winkler A., Xiao Y., Chaffron S., van Der Vossen J., Tang S., Katase M., McClure P., Kimura B., Chai L.C., Chapman J., Grant K., The use of next generation sequencing for improving food safety: Translation into practice, Food Microbiol, 79, pp. 96-115, (2019); Joseph A., Chapter 6: Salinity tolerance of inhabitants in thalassic and athalassic saline and hypersaline waters and salt flats, Water Worlds in the Solar System.

Typically, traditional disease detection methods are prone to human error and are labor-intensive, which makes this paper propose an alternative that uses CNN that is automatic, accurate, and scalable. The VGG16 model that was initially developed for massive image recognition tasks was later fine-tuned to fit the cotton leaf disease classification task and take advantage of a large dataset annotated with leaf images with high resolution. These images which are diverse sets of symptoms as well as other environmental conditions used, processed, and then augmented to help the model in training effectively. The findings of the research emphasize the transformative capability of applying deep learning technology for the identification and management of diseases in agriculture. The study has provided a diagnostic scalable, efficient, and accurate tool that contributes to the advancement of sustainable agriculture by enabling targeted, more effective disease management strategies. The fact that the fine-tuned VGG16 model has been proved successful in our research sets a new direction for the following studies concerning the use of other CNN architectures and the combination of these technologies with existing digital agriculture systems. This development guarantees a giant leap in the agricultural field and also offers a plausible solution to the challenge of plant diseases that impact crop yields and agricultural production. © 2024 IEEE.","Agriculture safety; Convolutional Neural Network; Cotton Disease Classification; VGG16","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image recognition; Large datasets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Viruses; Agriculture safety; Bacterial blight; Convolutional neural network; Cotton disease classification; Disease classification; Disease detection; Fusarium wilt; Leaf disease; Research papers; VGG16; Cotton","","","","","","","Sarangdhar A.A., Pawar V.R., Machine learning regression technique for cotton leaf disease detection and controlling using IoT, 2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA), pp. 449-454, (2017); Bhimte N.R., Thool V.R., Diseases Detection of Cotton Leaf Spot Using Image Processing and SVM Classifier, 2018 Second International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS), pp. 340-344, (2018); Singh P., Singh P., Farooq U., Khurana S.S., Verma J.K., Kumar M., CottonLeafNet: cotton plant leaf disease detection using deep neural networks, Multimed.

In today's world, digitalization has permeated every facet of life, simplifying the handling of complex tasks. It is imperative that the agricultural sector embrace technology and digitization to benefit both farmers and consumers. The integration of technology and regular monitoring holds the key to the early identification and eradication of crop diseases, ultimately leading to improved yields.Within this document, a methodology is presented for the identification and categorization of diseases afflicting potato plants. This approach relies on the widely recognized Plant Village Dataset, which offers open access to reliable data. The process begins with image segmentation, employing the K-means method to delineate regions of interest. Feature extraction is facilitated through the gray level double decomposition matrix in concurrence with three level concept, enabling the characterization of disease-related patterns.

Plant disease outbreaks have caused the biggest decline in agriculture, which has a substantial impact on the economy of the country and lowers the output of high-quality meals. Plant diseases have the power to eliminate species diversity and significantly reduce food output. Due to their invisible, often misconstrued symptoms and lack of readily available experience, plant diseases can be challenging for farmers to identify. This can delay identification and negatively impact crop productivity. The identification accuracy of image classification algorithms has significantly increased as a result of the early detection of various plant diseases using various detection methods. Deep learning methods have recently increased the precision of disease. Convolutional neural network, or CNN, models are used in the study that is being presented to identify disorders in plant leaves. The study leverages a dataset from Plant Village comprising 54,343 images categorized into 39 classes, each representing different plant species. For training, testing, and validation, we employed the previously trained Inception-V4 model.

The research focuses on disease identification and plant categorization, leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques for sustainable agricultural practices. Delayed detection and treatment of these diseases pose significant threats to harvest productivity, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention. Timely and accurate disease detection is crucial for improving sugar beet yield and quality for agricultural production. This study employed DL methods to classify sugar beet leaf images into healthy or diseased categories, followed by sub-classification into Cercospora beticola or Erysiphe betae. The proposed model's efficacy was evaluated through comparative analysis with established models such as the Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG16 and VGG19), InceptionV3, AlexNet, and ResNet50, renowned for their robust performance in image classification tasks. The dataset consisted of 4128 samples covering healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves, further classified as Cercospora beticola and Erysiphe betae. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model was compared with other models in terms of train time. Remarkably, although transfer learning is not implemented in the proposed model, it achieves 98% accuracy, 96% precision, 100% recall, and 98% F1-score, exceeding transfer learning models. This study advocates adopting a CNN model with a light-weight structure, facilitates rapid assembly, and has high recognition sensitivity of disease classification. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Sugar Research & Promotion 2024.","Cercospora beticola;

In traditional agriculture, farmers’ identification of pests and diseases primarily relies on experience, which has defects such as low efficiency and high misjudgment rate. Hiring experienced experts will significantly increase the cost of investment. Given the above problems, this study proposes an improved residual network for jute pest identification. Based on the ResNet18 model, a hybrid attention module is embedded to construct a new convolutional neural network, JuteNet. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the JuteNet network is 93.24%, which is 3.47% higher than that of the ResNet18 network. By introducing an appropriate amount of attention module, the recognition accuracy of the network can be improved without significantly increasing the training cost of the model. In addition, the network’s superiority is further demonstrated by ablation experiments and comparison with other models. This experiment verifies the feasibility of a deep-learning algorithm for plant pest identification.

Crop diseases significantly impact farmers' livelihood, making early detection and accurate diagnosis essential for informed crop management decisions that can improve yield and crop quality. While the manual diagnosis of plant diseases has limitations, research on automatic plant disease identification and categorization using computer vision algorithms is a popular research topic. We focus on leaf disease recognition and compare classification techniques to object detection techniques. Classification techniques in leaf disease recognition involve assigning an input image of a leaf to one of the pre-defined classes or categories, such as ""healthy""or ""diseased.""Object detection techniques, on the other hand, involve identifying the presence of an object of interest (e.g., a leaf) in an image and locating its boundaries, in addition to classifying the object. The advantage of object detection techniques over classification techniques in leaf disease recognition is that they provide additional information about the location of the disease on the leaf, which can be useful for tasks such as disease diagnosis and monitoring. In our work, 5100 chilli leaf images of 6 different classes were collected and labeled using the makeSense artificial intelligence (AI) annotating tool; we applied the YOLOv5s object detection model, producing a precision of 0.951, recall of 0.926, mAP@0.5 of 0.959, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.826, and accuracy of 95%. We also proposed an enhanced single-stage object detection model that employs the exponential linear unit activation function in the convolution layers and the sigmoid activation function at the output layer, resulting in a precision of 0.998, recall of 0.998, mAP@0.5 of 0.995, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.975, and accuracy of 99.83% for the chilli leaf dataset.  © 2023 SPIE and IS & T.","chilli leaf disease; classification; feature fusion; image annotation; mean average precision; object detection; YOLOv5s","Chemical activation; Crops; Deep learning; Image annotation; Learning systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Chili leaf disease; Classification technique; Features fusions; Image annotation; Leaf disease; Mean average precision; Objects detection; Plant disease; Single stage; YOLOv5; Classification (of information)","","","","","NIT Trichy","The first author (Bhookya Nageswararao Naik) gratefully acknowledges the NIT Trichy for providing financial assistance through Research Assistantship.

It has the functions of lowering blood pressure, lowering blood lipids and softening blood vessels, and it has high comprehensive utilization value. However, oil-tea camellia is often invaded by various disease and pest in the process of planting, which reduces its yield, how to use intelligent information technology to identify disease and pest in oil-tea camellia is of great significance. Recent developments in deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have shown prominent performance in the identification of crop pests and diseases. In order to solve the problems of low precision and weak generalization ability of traditional methods for oil-tea camellia disease and pest identification, this paper introduces an efficient CNN model based on mobile terminal that accurately identifies the common types of crop pest and diseases. The strategy of two-phase transfer learning (TL) is done during the training process. And an integration deep learning model based on the lightweight convolutional network architecture, feature extraction and fusion, and model compression is developed. The proposed model exhibits promising performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art models. Notably, the model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.78% for Camellia Oleifera diseases. The proposed model also shows strong generalization ability, it attains an average recognition accuracy of 99.55% on the widely utilized Plant village dataset. The model achieves recognition accuracies of 68.15% and 95.09% on the open-source IP102 dataset and the Real-world dataset respectively. The experimental results conclusively affirm the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach for the precise identification of Camellia Oleifera diseases. © 2023 IEEE.","camellia disease and pest; CNN; image classification; integration learning; mobile terminal","Blood; Blood pressure; Blood vessels; Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Image classification; Integration; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Plants (botany); Camellia disease and pest; Convolutional neural network; Generalization ability; Images classification; Integration learning; Learning models; Mobile terminal; Model-based OPC; Performance; Recognition accuracy; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Research Funds for the project of Automatic identification and diagnosis of plant disease; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (20720181004, 2023110200407); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research is partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities with grant No. of 20720181004, and also the work is partially supported by the Research Funds for the project of Automatic identification and diagnosis of plant disease and pest on mobile phone using big data techniques with grant No.of 2023110200407.

However, a number of illnesses can affect its cultivation and have a substantial impact on quality and yield. We offer a unique method for broccoli disease identification utilising a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to handle this problem. While the SVM makes the final illness classification, the CNN retrieves key information from leaf pictures. Our model's overall accuracy was 83.213% after it was trained and tested on a wide range of broccoli leaf image datasets. The outcomes show how well the combined CNN-SVM model performs in distinguishing between damaged and healthy broccoli leaves.

Reduced yield due to crop diseases can lead to immeasurable economic losses. Therefore, the detection and classification of crop diseases are of great significance. Based on AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, and DenseNet, this paper presents an Ensemble Network improve the recognition accuracy. In this study, firstly training four CNN models by randomly sampling the dataset. Before that, these CNN were improved by batch normalization and global average pooling to accelerate convergence, designed a dynamic concatenated ReLU, an improved activation function on ReLU, to improved detection performance. We use focal loss to solve data imbalance. Then weighted voting is used to fuse the four CNN models. Finally, we verify that the EnsembleNet can effectively improve the recognition performance compared with a single network. Verified improvement in recognition performance on our datasets, obtained from PlantVillag.org, containing 4577 citrus leaf images of three categories. The maximum test accuracy in identifying citrus leaf diseases was as high as 93.58%. Compared with single network, our EnsembleNet can significantly performance. The experimental results showed that this method can be practically applied to the identification of citrus leaf diseases and provides a basis for the identification of other plant leaf diseases.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Convolution Neural Network; Crop Disease; Deep Learning; Image Classification","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Losses; Citrus leaves; CNN models; Convolution neural network; Crop disease; Deep learning; Images classification; Leaf disease; Leaf images; Performance; Single-networks; Image classification","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972187); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Key Laboratory of Medical Big Data Engineering in Fujian Province, (KLKF202301); Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Department Guided Project, (2022H0012); Hainan Province, (YSPTZX202145); R&d Plan of Guangdong Province in key areas, (2020B0101090005)","Acknowledgement.

In order to classify tomato leaf diseases, this work gives a thorough comparison of many deep learning models. To help in the early identification and treatment of a variety of illnesses that affect tomato plants, this research seeks to determine the most efficient model for disease diagnosis. The study used a dataset of 20,000 photographs, each 768 by 768 pixels in size and divided into 10 different groups. These classes represented several tomato leaf ailments, such as Septoria Leaf Spot, Target Spot, Bacterial Spot, Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Late Blight, Leaf Mould, and Early Blight. They also included spider mites and two-spotted spider mites. 2,000 photos were distributed equally among each class, guaranteeing fair representation in all categories.This study used ResNetl52V2, ResNet50, VGG19, and Inception v2 as its four DL models. On the basis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, each model was trained and assessed using the dateset. The Inception v2 model fared better than the others, showing improved accuracy and precision in illness categorization, according to the data. This study highlights how DL might transform the way plant diseases are found and managed. The results imply that the higher performance of the Inception v2 model makes it potentially useful for the early identification and categorization of tomato leaf diseases. This might greatly improve crop management techniques, resulting in increased output and sustainability in the tomato agricultural industry. In order to further widen the applicability of DL: in agricultural technology, future study may examine the application of this model to additional crops and illnesses.  © 2023 IEEE.","Agricultural technology; Crop management; Deep learning models; Disease classification; Early detection; Inception v2; Plant diseases; Tomato leaf diseases Dataset; Yield improvement","Agricultural technology; Classification (of information); Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Fruits; Learning systems; Viruses; Agricultural technologies; Crop managements; Deep learning model; Disease classification; Early detection; Inception v2; Leaf disease; Learning models; Plant disease; Tomato leaf; Tomato leaf disease dataset; Yield Improvement; Diseases","","","","","","","Kon T., Melgarejo T., Almanzar A., Gilbertson R.L., Recent Emergence of the Mild Strain of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus as a Cause of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Disease of Processing Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicon) in the Dominican Republic, Plant Disease, 98, 11, (2014); Yang C., Feng Z., Wang Y., Jin M., Li T., Zhou J., Identification and colonization dynamics of an antagonistic endophytic bacterium 262XY2' against Pseudomonas syringae causing tomato leaf spot disease, European Journal of Plant Pathology, 161, 1, pp. 233-245, (2021); Watanabe H., Horinouchi H., Muramoto Y., Ishii H., Occurrence of azoxystrobin-resistant isolates in Passalora fulva, the pathogen of tomato leaf mould disease, Plant Pathology, 66, 9, pp. 1472-1479, (2017); Tabein S., Behjatnia S.A.A., Laviano L., Pecchioni N., Accotto G.P., Noris E., Miozzi L., Pyramiding Ty-l/Ty-3 and Ty-2 in tomato hybrids dramatically inhibits symptom expression and accumulation of tomato yellow leaf curl disease inducing viruses, Archiv Fur Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz, 50, 5-6, pp. 213-227, (2017); Canizares M.C., Rosas-Diaz T., Rodriguez-Negrete E., Hogenhout S.A., Bedford I.D., Bejarano E.R., Navas-Castillo J., Moriones E., Arabidopsis thaliana, an experimental host for tomato yellow leaf curl disease-associated begomoviruses by agroinoculation and whitefly transmission, Plant Pathology, 64, 2, pp. 265-271, (2015); Li M., Zhou G., Chen A., Li L., Hu Y., Identification of tomato leaf diseases based on LMBRNet, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123, (2023); Chen X., Zhou G., Chen A., Yi J., Zhang W., Hu Y., Identi fi cation of tomato leaf diseases based on combination of ABCK-BWTR and B-ARNet, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, (2020); Shahid M.S., Shafiq M., Ilyas M., Raza A., Al-Sadrani M.N., Al-Sadi A.M., Briddon R.W., Frequent occurrence of Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus in tomato leaf curl disease affected tomato in Oman, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, pp. 16634-16714, (2019); Chakraborty S., Pandey P., Banerjee M., Kalloo G., Fauquet C., Tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus, a new Begomovirus species causing a severe leaf curl disease of tomato in Varanasi, India, Phytopathology, 93, 12, (2003); Agarwal M., Singh A., Arjaria S., Sinha A., Gupta S., ToLeD: Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Convolution Neural Network, Procedia Computer Science, 167, pp. 293-301, (2020); Wu Q., Chen Y., Meng J., DCGAN-Based Data Augmentation for Tomato Leaf Disease Identification, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 98716-98728, (2020); Velasco L., Simon B., Janssen D., Cenis J., Incidences and progression of tomato chlorosis virus disease and tomato yellow leaf curl virus disease in tomato under different greenhouse covers in southeast Spain, Annals of Applied Biology, 153, 3, pp. 335-344, (2008); Li M., Zhou G., Chen A., Yi J., Lu C., He M., Hu Y., FWDGAN-based data augmentation for tomato leaf disease identification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 194, (2022); Trivedi N.K., Gautam V., Anand A., Aljahdali H.M., Villar S.G., Anand D., Goyal N., Kadry S., Early Detection and Classification of Tomato Leaf Disease Using High-Performance Deep Neural Network, Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 21, 23, (2021); Zhou C., Zhou S., Xing J., Song J., Tomato Leaf Disease Identification by Restructured Deep Residual Dense Network, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 28822-28831, (2021); Khan A.J., Akhtar S., Singh A.K., Briddon R.W., A Distinct Strain of Tomato leaf curl Sudan virus Causes Tomato Leaf Curl Disease in Oman, Plant Disease, 97, 11, pp. 1396-1402, (2013); Zhang Y., Huang S., Zhou G., Hu Y., Li L., Identification of tomato leaf diseases based on multi-channel automatic orientation recurrent attention network, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 205, (2023); Tao W., Ma J., Shi J., Lv W., Zhao M., Zheng L., Huang L., Weng S., Dual-strategy semi-supervised learning method based on GAN for recognition of tomato leaf diseases, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 43, 13, pp. 5025-5039, (2022); Ghosh H., Tusher M.A., Rahat I.S., Khasim S., Mohanty S.N., Water Quality Assessment Through Predictive Machine Learning, Intelligent Computing and Networking.

The year-round growth and availability of bananas provide consistent employment and income for the farmers. Plantain trees are highly affected by various pests and diseases. This will impact the health of the plants and overall production systems. Pests are the root cause of major diseases. Early identification of pests helps to control their impact on the health of plantain trees. Deep learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have already established their proficiency in the automatic detection of diseases and pests in humans and plants. This research work proposes a CNN model named WOAGE-MobileNetV2, which embeds an enhanced whale optimization algorithm (WOA) with the traditional MobileNetV2 model for improving efficient image classification. The experiments are carried out on the banana pest image dataset for detecting the earwigs, thrips, and weevils. The banana pest image dataset is a real-time dataset collected from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, located in Southern India.

Beans are an economically significant type of crops that not only provide a rich source of protein but also offers substantial health benefits. However, beans are susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. If left uncontrolled, these diseases could result in severe consequences. Diagnosis of the affected leaves can be done by plant pathologists, which is not readily available in local and remote areas. Using deep learning algorithms, an accurate classification of bean leaf diseases can offset this problem from an early stage. This research introduces a framework for optimizing MobileNetV3 using Particle Swarm Optimization that can accurately identify healthy or diseased bean leaves from images captured in real-world conditions. With having only 2.9M parameters, the best model achieved a high degree of accuracy at 98.44% on unseen data, outperforming the models proposed by other researchers on the same classification task. Results suggest that the model can be adopted in the field to increase the efficiency in the early identification of bean leaf diseases. Lastly, the same methodology can also be applied in solving plant leaf diseases from other economically significant crops.  © 2024 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Image Classification; Leaf Disease; Optimization; Swarm Intelligence; Transfer Learning","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plants (botany); Swarm intelligence; Bacterial infections; Deep learning; Health benefits; Human nutrition; Images classification; Leaf disease; Optimisations; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Transfer learning; Well being; Crops","","","","","","","Hayat I., Ahmad A., Masud T., Ahmed A., Bashir S., Nu-Tritional and Health Perspectives of Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.): An Overview, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 54, 5, (2014); Mullins A.P., Arjmandi B.H., Health benefits of plant-based nutrition: Focus on beans in cardiometabolic diseases, Nutrients, 13, 2, (2021); Schwartz H.F., Singh S.P., Breeding common bean for resistance to white mold: A review, Crop Science, 53, 5, (2013); Khalid M., Sarfraz M.S., Iqbal U., Aftab M.U., Niedbala G., Rauf H.T., Real-Time Plant Health Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Agriculture (Switzerland, 13, 2, (2023); Elfatimi E., Eryigit R., Elfatimi L., Beans Leaf Diseases Classi-fication Using MobileNet Models, IEEE Access, 10, (2022); Singh V., Chug A., Singh A.P., Classification of Beans Leaf Diseases using Fine Tuned CNN Model, Procedia Computer Science, (2022); Sahu P., Chug A., Singh A.P., Singh D., Singh R.P., Deep Learn-ing Models for Beans Crop Diseases: Classification and Visualization Techniques, International Journal of Modern Agriculture, 10, 1, (2021); Mehta S., Kukreja V., Gupta A., Collaborative Intelligence in AgriTech: Federated Learning CNN for Bean Leaf Disease Classifica-Tion, 2023 World Conference on Communication and Computing, WCONF, 2023, (2023); Abed S.H., Al-Waisy A.S., Mohammed H.J., Al-Fahdawi S., A modern deep learning framework in robot vision for automated bean leaves diseases detection, Int J Intell Robot Appl, 5, 2, (2021); Mallick M.T., Biswas S., Das A.K., Saha H.N., Chakrabarti A., Deb N., Deep learning based automated disease detection and pest classification in Indian mung bean, Multimed Tools Appl, 82, 8, (2023); Gill K.S., Anand V., Gupta R., Pahwa V., Bean Leaf Disease Classification and Visualization using Deep learning techniques on Sequential Model, 2023 International Conference in Advances in Power, Signal, and Information Technology, APSIT, 2023, (2023); Rahunathan L., Sivabalaselvamani D., Elakkiya E.S., Madhumitha M., Kumaresh K., Recognition of Bean Leaf Diseases Using Neural Network and Machine Learning Techniques, Proceedings-2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Data Intelligence, ICSMDI, 2023, (2023); Khalifa M.H., Ammar M., Ouarda W., Alimi A.M., Particle swarm optimization for deep learning of convolution neural network, Proceedings of 2017 Sudan Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology, SCCSIT 2017, (2017); Saleem M.A., Aamir M., Ibrahim R., Senan N., Alyas T., An Optimized Convolution Neural Network Architecture for Paddy Disease Classification, Computers, Materials and Continua, 71, 2, (2022); Fregoso J., Gonzalez C.I., Martinez G.E., Optimization of convo-lutional neural networks architectures using pso for sign language recog-nition, Axioms, 10, 3, (2021); Landeras E., Trapiello E., Brana M., Gonzalez A.J., Occurrence of angular leaf spot caused by Pseudocercospora griseola in Phaseolus vulgaris in Asturias, Spain, Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research, 15, 3, (2017); Wu X., Et al., Unravelling the Genetic Architecture of Rust Resis-Tance in the Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by Combining QTL-Seq and GWAS Analysis, Plants, 11, 7, (2022); Howard A., Et al., Searching for mobileNetV3, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, (2019); Eberhart R., Kennedy J., New optimizer using particle swarm theory, Proceedings of the International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, (1995)","D.B.

For timely intervention and effective disease management, earlier identification of these diseases is significant. Recently, the Deep Learning (DL) technique has had tremendous potential in the fields of Computer Vision (CV), involving recognition and classification of PLD. Researchers and developers have been capable of achieving tremendous performance in the identification and classification of PLDs by leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which aids in earlier diagnosis and intervention. This study offers a Modified Whale Optimization Algorithm with DL-Driven PLD Detection and Classification (MWOADL-PLDDC) technique. The MWOADL-PLDDC technique leverages the DL model with a hyperparameter tuning strategy for recognizing PLD. To obtain this, the MWOADL-PLDDC technique makes use of the Multi-Direction and Location Distribution of Pixels in Trend Structure (MDLDPTS) technique for feature extraction purposes. Meanwhile, the Deep Stacked Autoencoder (DSAE) method gets exploited for the recognition of healthy and diseased plant leaf images. For enhancing the detection rate of the DSAE approach, the IWOA is utilized to alter the hyperparameter value of the DSAE approach. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of the MWOADL-PLDDC technique in the accurate recognition and classification of PLDs. The MWOADL-PLDDC technique exhibits high accuracy in distinguishing healthy leaves from diseased ones and accurately identifying the specific disease type.  © 2024 Seventh Sense Research Group.","Computer vision; Convolutional whale optimization algorithm; Deep learning; Image classification; Plant leaf disease","","","","","","","","Kumar Chitranjan, Kumar Vipin, Vegetable Plant Leaf Image Classification Using Machine Learning Models, Proceedings of Third International Conference on Advances in Computer Engineering and Communication Systems, pp. 31-45, (2023); Munjal Deepkiran, Et al., A Systematic Review on the Detection and Classification of Plant Diseases Using Machine Learning, International Journal of Software Innovation (IJSI), 11, 1, pp. 1-25, (2023); Vasavi Pallepati, Punitha Arumugam, Venkat Narayana Rao T., Crop Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms by Visual Symptoms: A Review, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 12, 2, pp. 2079-2086, (2022); Panigrahi Kshyanaprava Panda, Et al., Maize Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Progress in Computing, Analytics and Networking.

However, the production of tomato crops is adversely affected due to different type of diseases. On one hand, timely recognition and classification of diseases is very essential for maintaining both the quality and quantity of tomatoes. And on the other hand, the combination of rising worldwide smartphone adoption and recent deep learning advancements has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease detection. Hence, to accomplish the above-mentioned perspectives, a custom CNN model (CCNN) is designed to classify various tomato plant diseases. In contrast to state-of-the-art architectures such as Alex net and VGG-16, the proposed CCNN model has three convolution layers followed by three fully connected layers which reduces the processing time and the computational power while achieving a greater accuracy in classification of various diseases. Also, the number of hyper parameters of the proposed model is significantly decreased as compared with the existing models. The competency of the proposed model is experimentally verified with 10 classes of tomato leaves both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results exhibit that the Custom CNN model attains competitive accuracy as compared with the conventional models with lesser computational cost. Further, the deployment of the proposed CCNN model in the mobile based system paves way for widespread global smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Plant disease; Smart farming","Convolution; Crops; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Fruits; Palmprint recognition; Plants (botany); CNN models; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Detection and identifications; Light weight; Plant disease; Smart farming; Smart phones; Tomato crops; Tomato plants; Smartphones","","","","","","","Agarwal M., Singh A., Arjaria S., Sinha A., Gupta S., Tomato leaf disease detection using convolution neural network, Procedia Comput Sci, 167, pp. 293-301, (2020); Ahmed A.A., Reddy G.H., A mobile-based system for detecting plant leaf diseases using deep learning, Agric Eng, 3, pp. 478-493, (2021); Aishwarya N., Praveena N.G., Akash Arumugam B.S., Pramod J., Photobook creation using face recognition and machine learning, Futuristic Communication and Network Technologies.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of these diseases holds paramount importance for effective disease management and safeguarding food security. In recent times, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been identified as remarkable models in achieving optimal results in image-processing tasks, including the identification of plant diseases and health diseases. The proposed work has been employed with a CNN model for rice leaf disease classification. The open-source data repository 'Kaggle' has been used as the source of the rice leaf disease dataset collection. Further, the CNN model has been trained for the automatic recognition and classification of four different kinds of rice leave diseases namely bacterial blight, blast, brown spot, and tungro. To build this CNN model, fine-tuning has been performed by changing the number of epochs and learning rate along with optimizers. The results show that the model has achieved the highest accuracy of 93.33% at epoch 14, whereas, at epoch 75 it has been identified as 75.56%. Furthermore, when the epoch was again increased to 100, the accuracy started to increase and resulted in 81.53% at epoch 100. In future, the model can be trained with the augmented images to achieve optimal results in the increased number of epochs. © 2023 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; deep learning; disease detection; machine learning; rice leaf disease","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cultivation; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Food supply; Image processing; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease detection; Global population; Leaf disease; Machine-learning; Neural network model; Optimal results; Rice leaf disease; Rice leaves; Neural network models","","","","","","","Jiang F., Lu Y., Chen Y., Cai D., Li G., Image recognition of four rice leaf diseases based on deep learning and support vector machine, Comput.

These days, deep learning models have shown better performance than hi-tech machine learning techniques in several fields, with computer vision being one of the most noticeable cases. Agronomy is one of the domains in which deep learning concepts have been used for disease identification on different parts of plants. Having a disease is very normal and common, but prompt disease recognition and early avoidance of crop diseases are crucial for refining production. Although the standard convolutional neural network models identify the disease very accurately but require a higher computation cost and a large number of parameters. This requires a model to be developed which should be efficient and need to generate less no of parameters. This research work proposed a model to identify the diseases of plant leaves with greater accuracy and efficiency compared to the existing approaches. The standard models like AlexNet, VGG, and GoogleNet along with the proposed model were trained on the Night shed plants leaf which is available in the plant village. It has 9 categorical classes of diseases and healthy plant leaves. A range of parameters, including batch size, dropout, learning rate, and activation function were used to evaluate the models' performance or achievement. The proposed model achieved a disease classification accuracy rate of 93% to 95%. According to the findings of the accuracy tests, the suggested model is promising and may have a significant influence on the speed and accuracy with which disease-infected leaves are identified. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

Effective crop management needs automatic techniques in farms. The crop gets damaged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses include salinity, drought, heat, heavy metals, and cold, whereas biotic stresses include crop diseases and plant pests. These stresses affect plant growth and development and produce low-quality yields with reduced crop productivity. Biotic stress causes damage to plants by agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and pests. Agricultural sustainability is a way of controlling biotic agents in an efficient manner and increasing productivity. Deep learning techniques allow correct and early identification of stress-causing agents, which helps a farmer to take preventive and corrective measures as early as possible to mitigate the problem. This paper presents a technique for training the deep neural network model to detect the disease symptom, classify the coffee leaves diseases, estimate the severity of identified diseases, and evaluate the performance of the developed system. The proposed model is a multi-task system for disease classification and severity estimation. In addition, we have experimented with new techniques of data augmentation for accurate results. Computational experiments for the proposed model are performed with several models such as DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, ResNet50, ResNet50v2, ResNet101, ResNet101v2, ResNet152, ResNet152v2, VGG16, VGG19, Mobile-Net, MobileNetv2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2. Dense Net outperforms all other models. DenseNet169 obtained 92.421% classification accuracy and DenseNet121 achieved 62.302% accuracy for severity estimation. The experimental results specify the proposed model is an effective tool to assist farmers in the early identification of coffee leaf diseases. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Crop Disease Classification; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Disease Recognition; Image Processing","Deep neural networks; Livestock; Biotic stress; Crop disease; Crop disease classification; Crop managements; Deep learning; Disease classification; Disease detection; Disease recognition; Disease severity; Images processing; Plant diseases","","","","","","","Ventura J.A., Costa H., Lima, I.d.M.: Manejo de pragas do café conilon, Café Conilon, 2Nd Ed, pp. 434-479, (2017); Kranz J., Measuring plant disease, Experimental Techniques in Plant Disease Epidemiology, pp. 35-50, (1988); Bock C., Poole G., Parker P., Gottwald T., Plant disease severity estimated visually, by digital photography and image analysis, and by hyperspectral imaging, Crit.

These diseases can decimate crops, disrupt food supply chains, and escalate the risk of food shortages, underscoring the urgency of implementing robust strategies to safeguard the world's food sources. Deep learning methods have revolutionized the field of plant disease detection, offering advanced and accurate solutions for early identification and management. However, a recurring problem in deep learning models is their susceptibility to a lack of robustness and generalization when facing novel crop and disease types that were not included in the training dataset. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel deep learning-based system capable of recognizing diseased and healthy leaves across different crops, even if the system was not trained on them. The key idea is to focus on recognizing the diseased small leaf regions rather than the overall appearance of the diseased leaf, along with determining the disease's prevalence rate on the entire leaf. For efficient classification and to leverage the excellence of the Inception model in disease recognition, we employ a small Inception model architecture, which is suitable for processing small regions without compromising performance. To confirm the effectiveness of our method, we trained and tested it using the widely acclaimed PlantVillage dataset, recognized as the most utilized dataset for its comprehensive and diverse coverage. Our method achieved an accuracy rate of 94.04%. Furthermore, when tested on new datasets, it achieved an accuracy rate of 97.13%. This innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy of plant disease detection but also addresses the critical challenge of model generalization to diverse crops and diseases. In addition, it outperformed the existing methods in its ability to identify any disease across any crop type, showcasing its potential for broad applicability and contribution to global food security initiatives. © 2024 China Agricultural University","Agriculture;

The major components of ayurvedic medicines are plant leaves, roots, stem, bark, leaf stalk, flowers etc. Ayurvedic plants cure several disorders such as lung diseases, gastro-intestinal disease, cardiac disorder, skin disorder, excretory diseases etc. So knowledge about these plants sustained by generations must be conserved. Also appropriate classification and identification of ayurvedic plants is essential for researchers, botanist, cultivator and doctors. Manual identification will be time consuming, imprecise and inaccurate. This paper proposes an automatic recognition system for the identification of different types of ayurvedic plant images using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on transfer learning method. For the performance evaluation the dataset is generated by capturing images using mobile device from the environment and from Google network. The dataset consist of 424 plant images of 21 types of ayurvedic plants. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed to display the informations of the detected ayurvedic plant.  © 2023 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Zhang L., Kong J., Zeng X., Ren J., Plant Species Identification based on Neural Network, Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation, (2008); Aptoula E., Yanikoglu B., Morphological features for leaf based Plant Recognition, Proc.

In an agroecosystem, staying aware of plant leaf diseases is a very important concern. The losses that farmers experience as a result of numerous plant leaf diseases can be reduced with earlier detection of these diseases. Manual recognition becomes very tedious in case of huge dataset and also recognition accuracy is greatly affected based on human expertise. To overcome this, automated intelligent strategies using deep learning (DL) convolution neural network (CNN) approach has gained popularity in recent times owing to the accurate diagnosis with reduced time and resource complexity. Combining with image processing, the patterns of leaf images at specific times are used to identify plant leaf diseases. For disease identification, classification and diagnosis, tomato plant is considered for current research work. Dataset for our research is captured from the real time environment from the agricultural fields of Jalgaon city. The proposed method is able to classify diseases with high precision by automatically extracting features thereby eliminating the feature engineering and threshold segmentation process. We adopt and extend our network utilizing spatial images captured in adverse environmental conditions. Automated disease diagnosis has been made possible by recent developments in computer vision through DL. Overall, a clear pathway for crop disease diagnosis on a gigantic worldwide scale is presented by the method of training deep learning models on progressively larger and publicly available and real time image datasets. © 2023","Convolution neural network; Crop disease diagnosis; Deep learning; Disease diagnosis","","","","","","","","Ngugi L., Abelwahab M., Zahhad M., Recent advances in image processing techniques for automated leaf pest and disease recognition – a review, Inform.

With the improvement of living standards and the development of the lotus industry chain, people are looking for green food, high-yield and high-quality products. Nowadays, many farmers and planters are unable to accurately identify the diseases and pests of lotus due to lack of professional knowledge of diseases and insect pests control. There is a shortage of efficient, low-cost and automatic identification technology for the prevention and control of lotus diseases and insect pests. The diagnosis and identification of diseases and insect pests are of great significance for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in lotus fields. Over the past few years, deep learning technology has been widely used in the field of plant diseases and insect pests recognition to automatically extract the features of plant diseases and insect pests. In order to achieve an efficient and accurate diagnosis of lotus leaf diseases and insect pests, lotus leaf diseases and insect pests dataset was constructed and preliminary experiments were constructed on AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet50, ResNeXt50, and DenseNet121 models. The experimental results indicated that DenseNet121 has the best performance on the dataset, lotus leaf diseases and insect pests identification model based on improved DenseNet was improved. Firstly, different methods for dynamic data enhancement were compared in this paper. The results show that resizing and randomly resizing the image is more accurate than directly resizing to the same size. The loss of detail information in part of the image is caused by over-compressing the image size, which affects the model’s recognition effect. The accuracy of the model was increased from 81.47% to 85.01% by using the data enhancement method of resize, random resized crop, random horizontal flip and random adjust sharpness. AdaMax optimizer was used to replace Stochastic Gradient Optimization optimizer and the accuracy of DenseNet model has been improved by 3.04 percentage points. The Stem block uses multi-layer small convolution for fast dimensionality reduction and a branch structure to combine convolution and maximum pooling. It improves the ability of the model to extract shallow features at a lower operating cost. The Squeeze and Excitation attention mechanism block and sharpen cosine similarity convolution were introduced in the Denselayer of the Dense Block and the Transition Layer. This method improved the recognition ability of the model to lotus leaf diseases, and verified the effectiveness of sharpen cosine convolution to improve the performance of the model. Transfer learning was performed on the Plantvillage dataset. The accuracy of the improved model is 91.34%, which 9.87 percentage points higher than before improvement and optimization. In order to solve the problem of monitoring diseases and insect pests in lotus fields, the improved model was applied to the identification of lotus field diseases and insect pests in UAV images. The calibration area of lotus leaf was cut and predicted by reasoning, then different masks were generated according to the model prediction results and added to the UAV image to generate a distribution map of lotus field diseases and insect pests. The recognition of lotus field diseases and insect pests in the UAV image was investigated, automatic classification and recognition of leaf spot, viral disease, Spodoptera litura, lotus Sclerotium leaf rot and lotus rhizome rot were realized. It provides a new method for efficient and accurate identification and dynamic monitoring of lotus diseases. It also supplies information supports for variable pesticide application and flight path planning in plant disease prevention and control based on UAV. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Prediction of plant diseases at the earliest stage may result in better yield and sustainable for growing population. The conventional method necessitates highly skilled inspectors to identify the phenotypic expression of different diseases. Alternatively, biochemical technologies offer more precise means of obtaining crop disease information by analyzing susceptible rice. However, these methods are time-consuming, expensive, reliant on laboratories, and require skilled professionals, rendering them unaffordable for most farmers. The paper aims to propose a solution to prevent infection at the earliest stage for the benefit of farmers. A novel crop disease detection model deploying a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) and with multidimensional feature compensation Residual Neural Network (MDFC-ResNet) and named as DC-GAN-MDFC–ResNet, which aims at fine grained disease identification system detects from three aspects, bacterial leaf blight, leaf streak and panicle blight. Initially the input data undergone preprocessing using the several processes like data improvement, data normalization, and Singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the negative influence that the data set has on the training of the model. When compared to traditional convolution models, the suggested DC-GAN-MDFC–ResNet architecture exhibits in terms of highest classification accuracy, Segmentation free methodology and training stability. The experiments done in this work using Plant Village dataset which show the proposed technique offering improved recognition with the rate of 95.99% accuracy and generating higher quality samples compared to other well-known deep learning models. © The Author(s) 2024.","Deep convolutional generative adversarial network and Residual Neural Network; Deep learning; Rice Crop diseases","agricultural technology; artificial neural network; bacterial disease; crop yield; detection method; identification method; Internet; machine learning; prediction; rice; segmentation; singular value decomposition","","","","","Taif University, TU, (TU-DSPP-2024-139); Taif University, TU","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to Taif University, Saudi Arabia, for supporting this work through project number (TU-DSPP-2024-139).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia, Project No. (TU-DSPP-2024-139).

Agricultural lands are being demolished generally owing to plant and crop illnesses. The detection of plant diseases by using image processing models can aid agriculturalists in defending the farming area from damaging or affecting it. Paddy is the main harvest worldwide. Early recognition of the paddy diseases at dissimilar phases of development is very vital in paddy production. However, the present manual technique in identifying and classifying paddy diseases needs a very educated farmer and is time-consuming. Deep learning (DL) is an effectual research area in the classification of agriculture patterns where it can efficiently solve the problems of diseases identification. Therefore, the articles focus on the design and expansion of Deep Learning based Crested Porcupine Optimizer for the Detection and Classification of Paddy Leaf Diseases (DLCPO-DCPLD) method for Sustainable Agriculture. The main aim of the DLCPO-DCPLD method use DL method for the recognition and identification of rice plant leaf diseases. To accomplish this, the DLCPO-DCPLD technique performs the image pre-processing using Median Filtering (MF) to recover the excellence of the input frames. Next, the ConvNeXt-L method is applied for extraction of feature vectors from the pre-processed images. Also, the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model is utilized for the automated classification of Paddy Leaf diseases. Eventually, the hyperparameter tuning of the CVAE technique is accomplished by implementing the Crested Porcupine Optimizer (CPO) technique. To safeguard the enhanced predictive results of the DLCPO-DCPLD method, a sequence of experimentations is implemented on the benchmark dataset. The experimental validation of the DLCPO-DCPLD method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.12% over existing approaches. ©2024 The Authors.

Human activities have resulted in increased plant diseases and endangered the habitats essential for the survival of a large number of plant species. Conservation of plant species and its disease control has become an imperative and emergency need to recover, restore, and maintain the plant diversity of natural habitats. Rapid developments in computer vision and mobile communication devices can greatly benefit the automation of plant species recognition, plant disease identification, and disease control. The proposed model is a combined system for disease detection and species identification by using images of healthy and unhealthy leaves. The model is trained and validated in an integrated dataset created by combining the standard datasets of species identification and disease detection of medicinal leaves. Proposed work studies the performance of two different hybrid deep learning architectures. First one makes use of Convolutional Siamese Network (CSN) a twin CNN model which requires only a small number of training samples. Second uses CNN followed by ensemble classifier configuration. Two types of base CNN models used are simple basic model (SM) and pre-trained model VGG16. The experimentation has shown that using a multi-learners model, CNN accuracy can be improved with fewer training images, without data augmentation, with less feature dimensionality. On an average 13.4% and 37.39% increase in accuracy was observed while using multi-learner model with CNN VGG16 model and CNN simple model (SM). CSN performance is better compare to that of CNN and CSN performs well with simple model compared with VGG16 and multi-learners. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Siamese network; Deep learning; Leaf disease detection; Multi-learners model; Plant species classification; Transfer learning","Conservation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Convolutional siamese network; Deep learning; Leaf disease detections; Learner modeling; Multi-learner model; Plant species; Plant species classification; Species classification; Transfer learning; Disease control","","","","","Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, KSCSTE","This work is supported by Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment (KSCSTE).","Manojkumar P., Surya C.M., Et al., Identification of Ayurvedic medicinal plants by image processing of leaf samples, Third International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks, (2017); Digital Image Processing Techniques for Detecting, Quantifying and Classifying Plant Diseases Barbedo Springerplus; Image processing techniques for detecting and classification of plant disease – a review, IMIP 2019; Kaggle Feature Dataset for Leaf Classification; A study on plant recognition using conventional image processing and deep learning approaches, J.

This research proposes an innovative approach to diagnose bacterial leaf blight (BLB), rice blast (RB), and brown spot (BS) in rice leaves utilizing the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN). By leveraging deep learning capabilities, the proposed model analyzes high-resolution images of rice leaves to classify and distinguish between the different diseases. The VGG16 architecture has shown remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, and this study aims to harness its potential for precision agriculture. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple crop that plays a crucial role in global food security. Timely and precise diagnosis of these diseases is vital for effective disease management and crop protection. Our methodology involves the collection and curation of a diverse dataset of rice leaf images. The VGG16 model, a proven deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, is employed for extraction of features and classification. The results of our study demonstrate the efficacy of the VGG16 model in distinguishing between different rice leaf diseases with remarkable precision. This high level of accuracy holds great promise for the field of agriculture, offering a non-invasive and efficient means of disease detection. Early disease identification can facilitate timely intervention, reducing crop losses and mitigating the economic impact on farmers. The classification accuracy of the proposed method is 97.77% using the publicly available dataset. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

In addition to already available methods for early disease detection and classification facing overfitting and fine feature extraction complexities during the training process, how early signs of green attacks can be identified or classified remains uncertain. Most pests and disease symptoms are seen in plant leaves and fruits, yet their diagnosis by experts in the laboratory is expensive, tedious, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Notably, how plant pests and diseases can be appropriately detected and timely prevented is a hotspot paradigm in smart, sustainable agriculture remains unknown. In recent years, deep transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous advances in the recognition accuracy of object detection and image classification systems since these frameworks utilize previously acquired knowledge to solve similar problems more effectively and quickly. Therefore, in this research, we introduce two plant disease detection (PDDNet) models of early fusion (AE) and the lead voting ensemble (LVE) integrated with nine pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned by deep feature extraction for efficient plant disease identification and classification. The experiments were carried out on 15 classes of the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 categories. Hyperparameter fine-tuning was done with popular pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, ResNet101, ResNet50, GoogleNet, AlexNet, ResNet18, EfficientNetB7, NASNetMobile, and ConvNeXtSmall. We test these CNNs on the stated plant disease detection and classification problem, both independently and as part of an ensemble. In the final phase, a logistic regression (LR) classifier is utilized to determine the performance of various CNN model combinations. A comparative analysis was also performed on classifiers, deep learning, the proposed model, and similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments demonstrated that PDDNet-AE and PDDNet-LVE achieved 96.74% and 97.79%, respectively, compared to current CNNs when tested on several plant diseases, depicting its exceptional robustness and generalization capabilities and mitigating current concerns in plant disease detection and classification. © The Author(s) 2024.","Climate action; Convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Logistic regression; Plant diseases; Responsible consumption and production; Transfer learning; Zero hunger","Fruit; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; agricultural worker; article; classifier; climate; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnosis; disease classification; feature extraction; food industry; food security; hunger; logistic regression analysis; nonhuman; plant disease; plant leaf; plant pest; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development goal; transfer of learning; voting","","","","","School of Digital Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam; Universiti Brunei Darussalam, UBD; Kementerian Pendidikan","This research was fully funded by the School of Digital Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, and the Ministry of Education (MoE), Universiti Brunei Darussalam.

This study aims to extend the recognition from known to unknown classes in the context of plants, termed Plant-relevant Open-Set Recognition (POSR). In this task, a trained model is required to either classify an input image into one of the known classes or an unknown class, even if the model is only trained with the images of known classes. To achieve this task, we propose a method to obtain a high-performance classifier with compact feature distributions for known classes. To have a high-performance classifier, a ViT model pre-trained in the PlantCLEF2022 dataset is transferred, following an observation that a plant-related source dataset is more beneficial to plant species and disease recognition than other commonly used datasets, such as ImageNet. To have compact feature distributions, we adopt additive margin Softmax loss (AM-Softmax) which brings the distance smaller between the features of the same known class and hence gives more spaces for the unknown class. Extensive experimental results suggest that our method outperforms current algorithms. To be more specific, our method obtains AUROC 93.685 and OSCR 93.256 on average on four public datasets, with an average accuracy of 99.295 on closed-set classification. We believe that our study will contribute to the community and, to fuel the field, our codes will be public. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Open set recognition; Plant disease recognition; Plant identification","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Compact Features; Deep learning; Feature distribution; Open set recognition; Performance; Plant disease; Plant disease recognition; Plant identification; Plant species; Unknown class; algorithm; biodiversity; data set; disease incidence; machine learning; recognition; Biodiversity","","","","","Korea Smart Farm Foundation; Ministry of Education, MOE, (2019R1A6A1A09031717, NRF-2021R1A2C1012174); Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA; Rural Development Administration, RDA, (421005-04); Rural Development Administration, RDA; Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, iPET; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","We appreciate the work and valuable suggestions of the editor and reviewers.

However, their use in the identification of soybean leaf diseases is currently limited and mostly based on machine learning methods. In this investigation an enhanced deep learning network model was developed to recognize soybean leaf diseases more accurately. The improved network model consists of three parts: feature extraction, attention calculation, and classification. The dataset used was first diversified through data augmentation operations such as random masking to enhance network robustness. An attention module was then used to generate feature maps at various depths. This increased the network’s focus on discriminative features, reduced background noise, and enabled the use of the LeakyReLu activation function in the attention module to prevent situations in which neurons fail to learn when the input is negative. Finally, the extracted features were then integrated using a fully connected layer, and the predicted disease category inferred to improve the classification accuracy of soybean leaf diseases. The average recognition accuracy of the improved network model for soybean leaf diseases was 85.42% both higher than the six deep learning comparison models (ConvNeXt (66.41%), ResNet50 (72.22%), Swin Transformer (77.00%), MobileNetV3 (67.27%), ShuffleNetV2 (59.89%), and SqueezeNet (72.92%)), thus proving the effectiveness of the improved method.The model proposed in this paper was also tested on the grapevine leaf dataset, and the performance ability of the improved network model remained due to other common network models, and overall the proposed network model was very effective in leaf disease identification. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Electric Power Supplies; Machine Learning; Neurons; Plant Leaves; Soybeans; machine learning; nerve cell; plant leaf; power supply; soybean","","","","","Science and Technology Development Plan Project of the Jilin Province, (YDZJ202201ZYTS692); Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University, JLASTU, (2023706)","This study was supported by the Science and Technology Development Plan Project of the Jilin Province (YDZJ202201ZYTS692) and the project of the Doctoral Initial Scientific Research Fund Supported by Jilin Agricultural Science and Technology University (No.2023706).

A variety of abiotic and biotic factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, temperature, insects, pathogens, and viruses can greatly impact the quantity and quality of rice grains. Studies have established that plant infections have a significant impact on rice crops, resulting in substantial financial losses in agriculture. To accurately diagnose and manage the diseases affecting rice plants, plant pathologists are seeking efficient and reliable methods. Traditional disease detection techniques, employed by farmers, involve time-consuming visual inspections and result in inadequate farming practices. With advancements in agricultural technology, the identification of pathogenic organisms in rice plants has become significantly more manageable through techniques such as machine learning and deep learning, which are receiving significant attention in crop disease research. In this paper, we used the transfer learning approach on 15 pre-trained CNN models for the automatic identification of Rice leave diseases. Results showed that the InceptionV3 model is outperforming with an average accuracy of 99.64% with Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Specificity as 98.23, 98.21, 98.20, and 99.80, and the AlexNet model resulted in poor performance with average accuracy of 97.35% among others. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; image classification; machine learning; plant disease detection; rice leaf diseases; transfer learning","","","","","","","","Chauhan B.S., Jabran K., Mahajan G., Rice Production Worldwide, 247, (2017); Khan N., Ray R.L., Sargani G.R., Ihtisham M., Khayyam M., Ismail S., Current progress and future prospects of agriculture technology: Gateway to sustainable agriculture, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Sharma A., Jain A., Gupta P., Chowdary V., Machine learning applications for precision agriculture: A comprehensive review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 4843-4873, (2020); Mathew A., Amudha P., Sivakumari S., Deep learning techniques: An overview, Advanced Machine Learning Technologies and Applications, Proceedings of AMLTA 2020, pp. 599-608, (2021); Lu Y., Yi S., Zeng N., Liu Y., Zhang Y., Identification of rice diseases using deep convolutional neural networks, Neurocomputing, 267, pp. 378-384, (2017); Han X., Zhang Z., Ding N., Gu Y., Liu X., Huo Y., Qiu J., Yao Y., Zhang A., Zhang L., Et al., Pre-trained models: Past, present and future, AI Open, 2, pp. 225-250, (2021); Eunice J., Popescu D.E., Chowdary M.K., Hemanth J., Deep Learning-Based Leaf Disease Detection in Crops Using Images for Agricultural Applications, Agronomy, 12, (2022); Thompson N.C., Greenewald K., Lee K., Manso G.F., The computational limits of deep learning, arXiv, (2020); Barbedo J.G.A., Impact of dataset size and variety on the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning for plant disease classification, Comput.

The research areas in the field of plant sciences for botanists and agriculturists include the identification of plant species, classification of weeds from crops, detection of various diseases that hamper the growth of plant, and monitoring the growth and its semantic interpretation. Trained botanists can easily identify plant species based on the leaf shape, texture, structure or arrangement of leaves, however, the recent trend in smart agriculture demands the use of intelligent systems for the same task. Last decade has seen an enormous rise in the use of deep learning in the field of automatic plant species recognition based on the leaf images. In this work, we have surveyed various state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (Convolutional Neural Networks, Mask RCNN, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks) that have been applied in the field of leaf image segmentation (separation of leaf from the whole image) and classification of leaves into various species. This contribution will help the new researchers in the field to get a foundation on the trends being employed in deep learning for generation of synthetic leaf images, segmentation and classification of leaves into various species.

Effectively distinguishing between different grape varieties not only promotes breeding efforts and the conservation of genetic resources but also has significant implications for agricultural development. As an integral component, leaves are often used for variety identification and classification. However, accurately distinguishing between different grape varieties based on leaf characteristics is challenging due to the subtle differences among them. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved Swin Transformer network. Firstly, it integrates shallow and deep features through a multi-stage feature fusion module to enhance the network's sensitivity to leaf details, and optimizes these features using a convolutional attention module. Finally, it combines inter-class similarity with one-hot labels to generate soft labels that contain semantic information from different classes, providing more effective supervision for the deep learning model and addressing the small sample size problem. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the model's recognition performance, achieving fine-grained identification of different grape leaf varieties. © 2024 IEEE.","Feature Fusion; Fine-Grained; Small Sample; Variety Identification","Fruits; Agricultural development; Features fusions; Fine grained; Genetic resources; Genetic traits; Grape leaves; Grape variety; Physiological characteristics; Small samples; Varieties identifications; Plant diseases","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (2022MS06021); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region","This research is supported by Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation Project (No.2022MS06021).","Wang B., Gao Y., Yuan X., Xiong S., Feng X., From species to cultivar: Soybean cultivar recognition using joint leaf image patterns by multiscale sliding chord matching, J. biosystems engineering, 194, pp. 99-111, (2020); Xu Q., Zhang M., Li Y., Tao Z., Learning more discriminative clues with gradual attention for fine-grained visual categorization, J.

Farmers can grow a wide range of crops. However, crop growth is hampered by illnesses. Plant pests are one of the reasons for the damage to plant crops. Different diseases affect different plants. The proposed work discussed a detailed investigation of disease recognition and classification. Implementing reliable methods with high recognition rates for diagnosing plant diseases is still on hold. Supervised learning techniques are mostly employed for the identification of diseases in plants. Unsupervised learning is an alternative, though. This suggested illness detection system includes image acquisition, pre-processing, segmenting the images, extracting features, and classification. As a result, image processing and feature extraction technologies have mainly been used to detect plant illnesses. This paper was classified based on two important concepts: leaf feature identification and classification. A detailed in-depth disclosure of disease identification and classification efficiency is depicted here, considering and evaluating certain well-defined suggested techniques by various authors from the last few decades. This paper also focuses on the state-of-the-art methodologies that came into the picture the in the present day in the boom of AI.

Traditional manual methods for disease identification are time-consuming and often yield inaccurate results. Automated systems leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques have emerged to improve accuracy and efficiency. Integrating these approaches allows image preprocessing and feature extraction to be combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized computer vision tasks, enabling hierarchical feature extraction. Hybrid methods offer advantages such as improved accuracy, faster identification, cost reduction, and increased agricultural productivity. This survey explores the significance and potential of hybrid approaches in plant disease identification, addressing the growing need for early detection and management in agriculture. © 2023 by IGI Global.

However, most previous studies only focus on the modification of deep learning models, while lacking research to systematically and scientifically explore the impact of different data sizes on the image recognition task for rice diseases. In this study, a functional model was developed to predict the relationship between the size of dataset and the accuracy rate of model recognition. RESULTS: Training VGG16 deep learning models with different quantities of images of rice blast-diseased leaves and healthy rice leaves, it was found that the test accuracy of the resulting models could be well fitted with an exponential model (A = 0.9965 − e(−0.0603×I50−1.6693)). Experimental results showed that with an increase of image quantity, the recognition accuracy of deep learning models would show a rapid increase at first. Yet when the image quantity increases beyond a certain threshold, the accuracy of image classification would not improve much, and the marginal benefit would be reduced. This trend remained similar when the composition of the dataset was changed, no matter whether (i) the disease class was changed, (ii) the number of classes was increased or (iii) the image data were augmented. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a scientific basis for the impact of data size on the accuracy of rice disease image recognition, and may also serve as a reference for researchers for database construction. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.","crop disease identification; data size; deep learning; image augmentation; transfer learning","Deep Learning; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Oryza; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; artificial neural network; chemistry; deep learning; image processing; Oryza; plant disease; plant leaf; procedures","","","","","Panjin Saline Alkali Land Utilization and Research Institute; Wuyuan Plant Protection Station; Donggang Demonstration Farm; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31471727, 61976097); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFD0300702); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515012203)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 31471727 and 61976097), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0300702) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2021A1515012203).

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and intense learning are extensively utilized in computer vision and recognition of pattern tasks. Scientists presented several DL algorithms for the detection of plant illnesses. Deep learning (DL) models need many parameters, resulting in extended training durations and complicated implementation on compact devices. This research presents a unique DL model utilizing the inception tier and residual connections. Depthwise differentiated convolution is employed to decrease the variable count. The suggested model has undergone training and evaluation using three distinct plant disease databases. The level of accuracy achieved on the PlantVillage database is 97.2%, on the rice disease database is 98.4%, and on the cassava database is 96.3%.

Plant diseases are one of the most essential factors affecting food security. Plant diseases often manifest pathological features on plant leaves. This paper combines deep learning with continual learning and federated learning, proposing a federated continual learning comprehensive model based on the Swin Transformer model (SSPW224-LwF-3). Our datasets come from shared datasets and integrate data from other datasets based on a ratio principle of 6:1:3 for the training set, validation set and test set (https://osf.io/v4qfr/?view_only=38b53e39988c4e1e82363031a921f799). Experimental results show that the SSPW224 model achieves an accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 97.20%, 95.25%, 94.85% and 94.71% on the test set. It is evident to find out that the SSPW224 model outperforms the other network models in the identification and classification of plant leaf diseases from the data and visualization perspectives. The average accuracy of the SSPW224-LwF-3 model strategy combination proposed in this study reaches the highest 47.06% among 18 combination strategies, with an accuracy of 49.41% and 33.81% for old and new data. The overall performance of this model is optimal. Therefore, the proposed SSPW224-LwF-3 model can achieve efficient, sustainable, and distributed recognition and classification of plant leaf diseases which provides a tool for plant disease identification in smart agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Continual learning; Deep learning; Federated learning; Leaf disease; Swin Transformer; t-SNE","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Continual learning; Deep learning; Disease diagnosis; Food security; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Swin transformer; T-SNE; Test sets; Federated learning","","","","","","","Sangeetha R., Logeshwaran J., Rocher J., Lloret J., An Improved agro deep learning model for detection of panama wilts disease in banana leaves, Agri.

The detection and classification of leaves is essential in agriculture, forestry, rural medicine, and other commercial applications, among other things. The diagnosis of sugar cane plant leaf disease is required for automatic weed identification in precision agriculture. This paper discusses a novel approach to the development of a plant disease recognition model that is based on sugar cane leaf image classification and employs deep convolutional networks to recognise disease in sugar cane plants. The method used for identification and automatic recognition investigates the possibility of using k-NN and SVM in pre-training with ANN, followed by CNN-based approaches for recognition. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.","Calssificaiton; KNN; Leaf Disease; ML; SVM","","","","","","","","Gupta S.

It is very essential to humans as a source of food. Plant diseases are major factors that affect the yield and quality of the plant. Digital image processing can determine plant diseases. Prediction of plant diseases has been implicated in the early stages of the agricultural sector. Thus, existing image process techniques employed plant disease features manually which is inefficient and results in poor recognition accuracy. This is often time-consuming and can result in poor precision and reproducibility. To tackle this issue, we introduce a proposed Hyper-Spectral Immutable Scaled Feature Selection (HSISFS) using Adaptive Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADCRNN) for leaf disease identification. It starts by pre-processing and scaling the region of plant leaf features to normalize the image pixel by reducing the noisy image based on Sampling Subset Feature Filtering (S2F2). Then, Ada Boosting Region-Based Segmentation (ABRS) technique employs for segregating leaf region parts. Based on the segmentation, the image analyzes the nearest maximum feature weight using Spider Optimization-Based Maximum Features Weight (SO-MFW). After that, the HSISFS method selects the plant leaf disease’s finest features. Finally, the ADCRNN algorithm with softmax logical activate function categorizes the leaf disease based on the finest features. Thus, the proposed produced high classification and detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure performance, with a low false rate. The classification accuracy performance results are superior than the existing methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Classification; Feature selection;

A comprehensive comprehension of the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to biological variety is necessary while species are distinct categories of living organisms; however, naming, identifying, and differentiating between species is more complex than it may seem. Traditional methods, relying on dichotomous keys and manual observation, are time-consuming and error-prone. Precise species identification is crucial for all taxonomic investigations and biological procedures. Numerous experts are currently engaged in the task of identifying a solitary species. To address these challenges, we present a robust artificial intelligence framework for species identification using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our approach utilizes a ResNet-50-based CNN to accurately classify 15 species, including humans, plants, and animals, from images taken at unique locations and angles. The dataset was pre-processed and augmented to enhance training, ensuring robustness against variations in lighting, occlusion, and background clutter. Featuring 4 million trainable parameters, our modified ResNet-50 model demonstrated superior computational efficiency and accuracy. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.5%, with class-specific accuracies of 98.25% for humans, 97.81% for animals, and 96.90% for plants. These results surpass those of existing models such as GoogleNet, VGG, SegNet, and DeepLab v3+, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

India is the largest cultivator of black gram crop globally, and its production is declined year by year because of the diseases that occurred to the black gram plant leaves. The plant disease recognition and classification systems that rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated encouraging results under limited and controlled circumstances. Such models are often constrained by a laeconomic losses to theck of consistency, making them less reliable. When detecting diseases with complicated background images taken from the cultivation field conditions, the models' accuracy would degrade drastically. To overcome this issue, firstly leaf region is segmented from all the images in the dataset using DeepLabv3 + layers with MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor. And then, the dataset was enhanced and expanded to 15000 images with the help of rotation, mirror symmetry, illumination correction, random shifting, and noise injection augmentation techniques. As a final step, proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model for the identification and classification of black gram plant leaf diseases, taking into consideration of a large number of parameters, size, and depth of the available state-of-the-art CNNs. The proposed DCNN model was trained and tested on the segmented leaf regions from the images in Black gram Plant Leaf Disease (BPLD) Dataset, which was created from real cultivated fields. The 5-fold cross-validation technique was employed to check the proposed model’s efficiency for detecting the diseases in all the scenarios. The performance evaluation and the investigation outcomes evident that the proposed DCNN model surpasses the state-of-the-art CNN algorithms with 99.54% accuracy, 98.80% F1 score, 98.78% precision and 98.82% recall for black gram plant leaf diseases classification and can provide a pragmatic solution for real-world applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Black gram; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Plant diseases","Convolution; Cultivation; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Neural network models; Plants (botany); Black gram; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Leaf disease; Neural network model; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Recognition systems; State of the art; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Abed S.H., Al-Waisy A.S., Mohammed H.J., Et al., A modern deep learning framework in robot vision for automated bean leaves diseases detection, Int J Intell Robot Appl, 5, pp. 235-251, (2021); Anagnostis A., Asiminari G., Papageorgiou E., Bochtis D., A Convolutional neural networks based method for anthracnose infected walnut tree leaves identification, Appl Sci, 10, 2, (2020); Barbedo J.G.A., Impact of Dataset size and variety on the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning for plant disease classification, Comput Electron Agric, 153, pp. 46-53, (2018); Brahimi M., Boukhalfa K., Moussaoui A., Deep learning for tomato diseases: classification and symptoms visualization, Appl Artif Intell, 31, 4, pp. 299-315, (2017); Chen L.C., Zhu Y., Papandreou G., Schroff F., Adam H., Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation, Computer Vision – ECCV 2018.

Plant disease is a major cause of reduced production, but can be managed with regular monitoring. Manually observing plant diseases takes more time and is error-prone. Early detection of plant diseases with the aid of artificial intelligence and computer vision can decrease the effects of disease and help plants withstand the downsides of continuing surveillance. In this manuscript, plant disease identification using contextual mask auto-encoder optimized with dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm (PDI-CMAE-DDAOA) is proposed. The plant village dataset is used to collect the images. Then the image is fed to preprocessing. Using an adaptive self-guided filter approach, the noise is removed from the input images during the pre-processing phase. The result of the pre-processing section serves as input for the feature extraction segment. Four statistical features, including mean, variance, entropy, and kurtosis, are recovered from the cosine similarity hidden Markov model (CSHMM). The contextual mask auto-encoder (CMAE) is given the extracted features to accurately classify the healthy and unhealthy regions of the plant image. The issue of slow convergence affects the CMAE. However, it is noted that the CMAE converges more quickly with deep learning features than with texture features in this instance. The CMAE classifier generally does not exhibit any adaptation of optimization algorithms for determining the best parameters to ensure the precise classification of plant disease. Therefore, dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm (DDAOA) is considered to enhance the CMAE classifier, which accurately distinguishes between healthy and diseased plants. The proposed PDI-CMAE-DDAOA is done in Python. The efficacy of PDI-CMAE-DDAOA is evaluated under some performance metrics, like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, error rate, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), computational time. The proposed method provides higher accuracy 23.34%, 34.33%, and 32.07%; higher sensitivity 36.67%, 36.33%, and 23.21%; higher F1-score 46.67%, 57.56%, and 43.21%; higher specificity 56.67%, 67.56%, and 23.21% analyzed with existing models, like transfer learning-based deep ensemble neural network for plant leaf infection recognition (PDI-DENN), plant disease detection with hybrid model based on convolutional auto-encoder and convolutional neural network (PDI-CAE-CNN), and automatic and reliable leaf disease finding depending on deep learning methods (PDI-EN-CNN), respectively. Research Highlights: To find the plant disease at early stage. To present PDI-CMAE-DDAOA. To get better classification accuracy by extracting the optimal features with the help of efficient CSHMM. To minimize the error during classification process. To maximize high area under curve value. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","adaptive self-guided filter; contextual mask auto-encoder; cosine similarity hidden Markov model; dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm; plant leaf disease identification","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Annealing; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Optimization; Signal encoding; Textures; Adaptive self-guided filter; Auto encoders; Contextual mask auto-encoder; Cosine similarity; Cosine similarity hidden markov model; Dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm; Guided filters; Hidden-Markov models; Leaf disease; Optimization algorithms; Plant leaf disease identification; Plant leaves; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; image processing; procedures; Hidden Markov models","","","","","","","Ahmed A.A., Reddy G.H., A mobile-based system for detecting plant leaf diseases using deep learning, AgriEngineering, 3, 3, pp. 478-493, (2021); Ashwinkumar S., Rajagopal S., Manimaran V., Jegajothi B., Automated plant leaf disease detection and classification using optimal MobileNet based convolutional neural networks, Materials Today: Proceedings, 51, pp. 480-487, (2022); Bari B.S., Islam M.N., Rashid M., Hasan M.J., Razman M.A.M., Musa R.M., Nasir A.F.A., Majeed A.P.A., A real-time approach of diagnosing rice leaf disease using deep learning-based faster R-CNN framework, PeerJ Computer Science, 7, (2021); Chen H.C., Widodo A.M., Wisnujati A., Rahaman M., Lin J.C.W., Chen L., Weng C.E., AlexNet convolutional neural network for disease detection and classification of tomato leaf, Electronics, 11, 6, (2022); Dananjayan S., Tang Y., Zhuang J., Hou C., Luo S., Assessment of state-of-the-art deep learning based citrus disease detection techniques using annotated optical leaf images, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 193, (2022); Dhaka V.S., Meena S.V., Rani G., Sinwar D., Ijaz M.F., Wozniak M., A survey of deep convolutional neural networks applied for prediction of plant leaf diseases, Sensors, 21, 14, (2021); Gargade A., Khandekar S., Custard apple leaf parameter analysis, leaf diseases, and nutritional deficiencies detection using machine learning.

Medical plants along with leaves have medical values and helps in curing many diseases. But correctly identifying leaves is laborious that takes lots of time and expertise. Therefore, the identification of these medical species is a challenging task. As a result, vision based approach helps the regular people in rapid identification of herbal leaves. This paper highlights vision based system to recognise herbal leaf by creating advanced deep learning models such as YOLOV5, YOLOV8 and Resnet-50. The Dataset for Indian Medicinal Plant Species Analysis and Recognition (DIMPSAR) which was published in 2023 is used to evaluate deep learning models. The experiment is performed on Colab environment. The evaluation metrics showed that YOLOV8 outperforms the other two models in term of accuracy with 99.2 percentage. The best architecture is further deployed in mobile application using teachable machine.  © 2024 IEEE.","DL models; Medical Leaf; mobile app; ResNet 50; YOLO","Forestry; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Plants (botany); Application frameworks; DL model; Leaf classification; Learning models; Medical leave; Medicinal herb; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Resnet 50; YOLO; Deep learning","","","","","","","Abera B., Medicinal plants used in traditional medicine by Oromo people, Ghimbi District, Southwest Ethiopia, J.

Knowing the logic or features is highly crucial for result verification, algorithm improvement, training data improvement, and knowledge extraction. However, the explanations from the current heatmap-based algorithms are insufficient for the abovementioned requirements. To address this, this paper details the development of a classification and explanation method based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture, which can visualize the variations of the most important features by visualizing the generated images that correspond to the variations of those features. Using the PlantVillage dataset, an acceptable level of explainability was achieved without sacrificing the classification accuracy. The proposed method can also be extended to other crops as well as other image classification tasks. Further, application systems using this method for disease identification tasks, such as the identification of potato blackleg disease, potato virus Y, and other image classification tasks, are currently being developed. © 2024 The Authors","Crop disease classification; Disentangled representation; Explainable deep learning; Feature visualization; Variational autoencoder","Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Crops; Decision making; Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Viruses; Auto encoders; Classification tasks; Crop disease; Crop disease classification; Disease classification; Disentangled representation; Explainable deep learning; Feature visualization; Images classification; Variational autoencoder; Image classification","","","","","National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, NARO, (Mo_B_Bou_1); National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, NARO; Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution, BRAIN, (01022C); Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution, BRAIN","Part of this research was supported by NARO, “Research project for technologies to strengthen the international competitiveness of Japan's agriculture and food industry , grant number: Mo_B_Bou_1 ” and a Project of the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (Research Program on Development of Innovative Technology , project ID: 01022C ).

Accurate and early detection of tomato diseases is crucial for reducing losses and improving crop management. Current deep learning and CNN research have resulted in the availability of multiple CNN designs, making automated plant disease identification viable rather than traditional visual inspection-based disease detection. When using deep learning Methods, the dataset serves one of the most crucial roles in disease prediction. PlantVillage is the most widely used publicly available dataset for tomato disease detection, but it was created in a laboratory/controlled environment, and models trained on it do not perform well on real-world images. Some natural or real-world datasets are available, but they are private and not publicly available. Also, when attempting to predict tomato diseases on the field in the Jodhpur and Jaipur districts of Rajasthan, India, we found that the majority of diseases are leaf miner, spotted wilt virus, and Nnutrition deficiency diseases, but there are no public datasets containing such categories. To overcome these challenges, we propose the creation of a new dataset called “Tomato-Village” with three variants: (a) multiclass tomato disease classification, (b) multilabel tomato disease classification, and (c) object detection-based tomato disease detection. To our best knowledge, “Tomato-Village” will be the first such dataset to be available publicly. Further, we have applied the various CNN architectures/models on this dataset, and baseline results were drawn.

Its potential is enormous and has already found practical applications in several fields, including autonomous driving, automatic speech recognition, medical research, image restoration, natural language processing, and, among others. DL has been recently introduced in agriculture showing promising results in solving various farming problems like disease detection, automated plant and fruit identification, and counting. This study presents a comprehensive review of research using DL techniques in farming, including crop monitoring, crop mapping, weed and pest detection and management, irrigation, fruit grading, reorganizations of species and herbicide identification. Furthermore, different DL techniques applied in various fields are analyzed and compared with existing techniques. It was found that DL outperforms traditional image processing technology in terms of accuracy, both in classification and regression. Additionally, the study suggests that DL can be applied beyond detections, classification tasks to yield production, and disease segmentation in agriculture. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Despite effective advancements in deep learning techniques for the classification of chili leaf diseases, most existing classification models still face challenges in terms of accuracy and practical application in disease identification. Therefore, in this study, an optimized and enhanced convolutional neural network model named MCCM (MCSAM-ConvNeXt-MSFFM) is proposed by introducing ConvNeXt. The model incorporates a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module (MSFFM) aimed at better capturing disease features of various sizes and positions within the images. Moreover, adjustments are made to the positioning, activation functions, and normalization operations of the MSFFM module to further optimize the overall model. Additionally, a proposed Mixed Channel Spatial Attention Mechanism (MCSAM) strengthens the correlation between non-local channels and spatial features, enhancing the model’s extraction of fundamental characteristics of chili leaf diseases. During the training process, pre-trained weights are obtained from the Plant Village dataset using transfer learning to accelerate the model’s convergence. Regarding model evaluation, the MCCM model is compared with existing CNN models (Vgg16, ResNet34, GoogLeNet, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet, EfficientNetV2, ConvNeXt), and Swin-Transformer. The results demonstrate that the MCCM model achieves average improvements of 3.38%, 2.62%, 2.48%, and 2.53% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively. Particularly noteworthy is that compared to the original ConvNeXt model, the MCCM model exhibits significant enhancements across all performance metrics. Furthermore, classification experiments conducted on rice and maize disease datasets showcase the MCCM model’s strong generalization performance. Finally, in terms of application, a chili leaf disease classification website is successfully developed using the Flask framework. This website accurately identifies uploaded chili leaf disease images, demonstrating the practical utility of the model.

They negatively impact crops and the means of livelihood for farming communities. The need for automated solutions becomes evident when we consider how labor-intensive and error-prone traditional manual methods are for identifying illnesses. Our study FloraCheck investigates plant disease identification using the EfficientNetB3 model by using deep learning. We have chosen the PlantVillage dataset and implemented advanced image preprocessing techniques for effective model training. Existing approaches show differences in the data and models they use and often struggle with limitations such as dataset specificity and a lack of comprehensive generalization. FloraCheck is bridging these gaps by harnessing the power of EfficientNetB3 through transfer learning, ensuring adaptability to a diverse range of plant diseases. The model is refined through strategic construction involving batch normalization, regularization, dropout and a final classification layer. This ensures the development of a robust and adaptive framework for accurately detecting plant diseases. Our project has achieved an accuracy rate of 98.93%, signifying a considerable advancement in the automated detection of plant diseases. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

They represent a severe threat for both economy and global food security. Recently, several researches have been proposed for plant disease identification through modern image-based recognition systems based on deep learning. However, several challenges still require further investigation. One is related to the high variety of leaf diseases/ species along with constraints related to the collection and annotation of real-world datasets. Other challenges are related to the study of leaf disease in uncontrolled environment. Compared to major existing researches, we propose in this article a new perspective to handle the problem with two main differences: First, while most approach aims to identify simultaneously a pair of species-disease, we propose to identify diseases independently of leaf species. This helps to recognize new species holding diseases that were previously learnt. Moreover, instead of using the global leaf image, we directly predict disease on the basis of the local disease symptom features. We believe that this may decrease the bias related to common context and/or background and enables to build a more generalised model for disease classification. In particular, we propose an hybrid system that combines strengths of deep learning-based semantic segmentation with classification capabilities to respectively extract infected regions and determine their identity. For that, an extensive experimentation including a comparison of different semantic segmentation and classification CNNs has been conducted on PlantVillage dataset (leaves within homogeneous background) in order to study the extent of use of local disease symptoms features to identify diseases. Specifically, a particular enhancement of disease identification accuracy has been demonstrated in IPM and BING datasets (leaves within uncontrolled background). © 2023","Classification; Deep learning; Plant disease; Segmentation; Uncontrolled environment","algorithm; identification method; new species; segmentation; symptom","","","","","Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, PSAU, (2019/01/11008); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","This project was supported via funding by the Deanship of Scientific research at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University under the research project 2019/01/11008 .","Afzaal U., Bhattarai B., Pandeya Y.R., Lee J., An instance segmentation model for strawberry diseases based on mask r-cnn, Sensors, 21, 19, (2021); Ahmed N., Asif H.M., Saleem G., (2021); Ali H., Lali M., Nawaz M., Sharif M., Saleem B., Symptom based automated detection of citrus diseases using color histogram and textural descriptors, Comput.

For precision agriculture to work, pests, weeds, and diseases must be easy to find and identify on plant leaves. Most plant diseases have symptoms that can be seen, and plant pathologists now agree that infected plant leaves are the best way to find them. This is a good use for computer-aided diagnostic systems because diagnosing diseases manually (hands and eyes) takes a long time, and the effectiveness of diagnostic treatment depends on how well the pathologist does (intra-observer variability). Based on what we need right now, we need a model that doesn’t need much pre-processing and doesn’t need manual functional (feature) extraction. So, in this study, methods for identifying and classifying plant diseases from leaf images taken at different resolutions are described that are based on deep learning. Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) image analysis, the main goal of this research is to help tell the difference between healthy and unhealthy leaves. We have also come up with a new model called PlaNet. Its performance has been compared to that of other common CNN models. We did a lot of testing and verification on 18 well-known CNN models based on deep learning, including one ensemble model made up of the five best models. We did this on four different combinations of three well-known standard benchmark datasets. The suggested PlaNet model has been tested, and the results show that it works in a highly efficient manner. It has been found that, among all the testing experiments, the best average-wise performance achieved was up to 97.95% accuracy, 0.9752 AUC, 0.9686 F1-score, 0.9707 sensitivity, 0.9576 precision, and 0.9456 specificity, respectively. So, the results of the tests show that the proposed system, which is based on deep learning, can classify different types of plant leaves quickly and accurately. When used alone or with other datasets (four different combinations of three datasets), the suggested model works very well. This shows that the proposed model is more flexible, general, and scalable than other approaches that are already in use. The fact that it must be able to accurately process a single image of a plant leaf in less than a second demonstrates its real-time capabilities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep convolution neural networks; Deep learning; Ensemble model; Image classification; Leaf diseases identification; Transfer learning","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Well testing; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolution neural network; Deep learning; Ensemble models; Images classification; Leaf disease; Leaf disease identification; Plant leaves; Transfer learning; Image classification","","","","","","","Abbas A., Jain S., Gour M., Vankudothu S., Tomato plant disease detection using transfer learning with C-GAN synthetic images, Comput Electron Agric, 187, (2021); Agarwal N., Singhai J., Agarwal D.K., Grape Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Multi- Class Support Vector Machine, Proceeding of IEEE International Conference on Recent Innovations in Signal Processing and Embedded Systems (RISE), pp. 238-244, (2017); Agarwal M., Gupta S.K., Biswas K.K., Development of Efficient CNN model for Tomato crop disease identification, Sustain Comput: Inform Syst, 28, (2020); Agarwal M., Gupta S., Biswas K.K., A new Conv2D model with modified ReLU activation function for identification of disease type and severity in cucumber plant, Sustain Comput: Inform Syst, 30, (2020); Ardakani A.A., Kanafi A.R., Acharya U.R., Khadem N., Mohammadi A., Application of deep learning technique to manage COVID-19 in routine clinical practice using CT images: Results of 10 convolutional neural networks, Comput Biol Med, 121, (2020); Arribas J.I., Sanchez-Ferrero G.V., Ruiz-Ruiz G., Gomez-Gil J., Leaf classification in sunflower crops by computer vision and neural networks, Comput Electron Agric, 78, 1, pp. 9-18, (2011); Atila U., Ucar M., Akyol K., Ucar E., Plant leaf disease classification using efficientnet deep learning model, Ecol Inform, 61, (2021); Babu M.P., Rao B.S., Leaves recognition using back propagation neural network-advice for pest and disease control on crops, Indiakisan.

Early identification of plant diseases is crucial since it plays an important role in the plant's yield and the farmers’ well-being. In South Africa, two commercially significant maize diseases are Fusarium ear rot and Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NCLB), both caused by Exserohilum turcicum. In corn cultivation, the disease northern corn leaf blight causes up to 50% loss in the yield. The detection of NCLB must be automated with high accuracy to help the farmers. The detection and classification of plant diseases, such as the northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), has become a focal point of research in agricultural plant protection. The study of NCLB has emerged as a significant area for investigating methods and techniques related to plant disease detection. By incorporating and applying deep learning techniques for plant disease recognition, we can alleviate the adverse consequences of manually selecting disease spot features. This approach enhances the precision of extracting plant disease features, fosters rapid technological advancement, and brings significant benefits to the farming community. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, the paper discusses the current trends and challenges in recognizing plant leaf diseases. Notably, the study employs a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to effectively detect northern corn leaf blight (NCLB). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Agriculture; CNN; Deep learning; Disease detection; Northern corn leaf blight","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Digital era; Disease detection; Leaf blights; Learning models; Learning techniques; Network-based; Northern corn leaf blight; Plant disease; Plant diseases","","","","","","","Panigrahi K.P., Das H., Sahoo A.K., Moharana S.C., Maize leaf disease detection and classification using machine learning algorithms, in Progress in Computing, Analytics and Networking: Proceedings of ICCAN, 2019, pp. 659-669, (2020); Bachhal P., Kukreja V., Ahuja S., Maize disease classification using deep learning techniques: A review, International Conference on Advancement in Computation & Computer Technologies (Incacct) (2023), pp. 259-264, (2023); Song B., Lee J., Detection of northern corn leaf blight disease in real environment using optimized YOLOv3, 2022 IEEE 12Th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC) (2022), pp. 475-480; Jin I.J., Et al., Deep-learning-based system-scale diagnosis of a nuclear power plant with multiple infrared cameras, J.

Plant leaf images are often affected by factors such as complex backgrounds, climate, light, and sample data imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight convolutional neural network, ICS-ResNet, based on ResNet50. This network incorporates improved spatial and channel attention modules as well as a deep separable residual structure to enhance recognition accuracy. (1) The residual connections in the ResNet network prevent gradient loss during deep network training. (2) The improved channel attention (ICA) and spatial attention (ISA) modules fully utilize semantic information from different feature layers to accurately localize key features of the network. (3) To reduce the number of parameters and lower computational costs, we replace traditional convolutional computation with a depth-separable residual structure. (4) We also employ cosine annealing to dynamically adjust the learning rate, enhancing the network’s training stability, improving model convergence, and preventing local optima. Experiments on the corn dataset in Plant Village compare the proposed ICS-ResNet with eight popular networks: CSPNet, InceptionNet_v3, EfficientNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152. The results show that the ICS-ResNet achieves an accuracy of 98.87%, which is 5.03%, 3.18%, 1.13%, 1.81%, 1.13%, 0.68%, 0.44% and 0.60% higher than the other networks, respectively. Furthermore, the number of parameters and computations are reduced by 69.21% and 54.88%, respectively, compared to the original ResNet50 network, significantly improving the efficiency of corn leaf disease classification. The study provides strong technical support for sustainable agriculture and the promotion of agricultural science and technology innovation. © 2024 by the authors.","attention mechanism; convolutional neural network; depth separable residual structure; image recognition; leaf disease; maize","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology National Foreign Expertise Project, (G2022042005L); Gansu Agricultural University, GAU, (2023-09); Gansu Agricultural University, GAU; Gansu Higher Education Institutions Industrial Support Project, (2023CYZC-54); Gansu Key R&D Program, (23YFWA0013); Natural Science Foundation of Shenyang Municipality, (LGF22H120009); Natural Science Foundation of Shenyang Municipality; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Talent Project of Lanzhou, (2021-RC-47); Innovation and Entrepreneurship Talent Project of Lanzhou; Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, (2023D15)","This research was funded by Lanzhou Municipal Talent Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project (2021-RC-47), Ministry of Science and Technology National Foreign Expertise Project (No. G2022042005L), Gansu Higher Education Institutions Industrial Support Project (No. 2023CYZC-54), Gansu Key R&D Program (No. 23YFWA0013) Gansu Agricultural University Aesthetic and Labor Education Teaching Reform Project (No. 2023-09), the Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory (No. 2023D15) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang, China (LGF22H120009).","Li Q., Li Y., Mechanism and economic effect of agricultural equipment digital intelligence to enhance food security, J.

The current fine-grained identification methods have not considered features of different scales, which is crucial for extracting more discriminative features. Additionally, the presence of small inter-class differences and large intra-class differences in fine-grained classification tasks significantly heightens the challenges of accomplishing accurate fine-grained classification. To address these issues, we have designed a dual-branch cross-fusion fine-grained network to integrate different-scale features and enhance the discriminative ability of deep learning features. Specifically, we have developed a multi-scale cross-fusion attention module to fuse features of different scales and retain the most important areas for classification and recognition. Moreover, we have employed a simple and effective centre loss on the dual-branch network to obtain deep features with key learning objectives, namely, inter-class distribution and intra-class compactness. Experimental results on the iNat2021-Plants, iNat2018-Plants, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves recognition accuracies of 76.8%, 73.8%, and 93.6%, respectively. This indicates that the method is capable of more precise fine-grained recognition and provides new insights for AI-assisted invasive plant identification systems. © 2024 Acta Press.

Therefore, an automated, early, and precise leaf disease recognition system is essential for farmers to ensure the quality and quantity of tomato production by providing timely interventions to mitigate disease spread. In this study, we have proposed seven robust Bayesian optimized deep hybrid learning models leveraging the synergy between deep learning and machine learning for the automated classification of ten types of tomato leaves (nine diseased and one healthy). We customized the popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for automatic feature extraction due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies of features directly from raw data and classical machine learning techniques [Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, GaussianNB (GNB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)], and stacking for classifications. Additionally, the study incorported a Boruta feature filtering layer to capture the statistically significant features. The standard, research-oriented PlantVillage dataset was used for the performance testing, which facilitates benchmarking against prior research and enables meaningful comparisons of classification performance across different approaches. We utilized a variety of statistical classification metrics to demonstrate the robustness of our models. Using the CNN-Stacking model, this study achieved the highest classification performance among the seven hybrid models. On an unseen dataset, this model achieved average precision, recall, f1-score, mcc, and accuracy values of 98.527%, 98.533%, 98.527%, 98.525%, and 98.268%, respectively. Our study requires only 0.174 s of testing time to correctly identify noisy, blurry, and transformed images. This indicates our approach's time efficiency and generalizability in images captured under challenging lighting conditions and with complex backgrounds. Based on the comparative analysis, our approach is superior and computationally inexpensive compared to the existing studies. This work will aid in developing a smartphone app to offer farmers a real-time disease diagnosis tool and management strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bayesian optimization; Boruta; CNN; Deep learning; Hybrid learning; Machine learning; Tomato leaf disease; Tree-structured Parzen Estimator","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Solanum lycopersicum; Support Vector Machine; algorithm; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; deep learning; machine learning; plant disease; plant leaf; support vector machine; tomato","","","","","King Saud University, KSU","The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Researchers Supporting Project Number (RSP2024R410), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

However, mulberry trees are highly susceptible to diseases, spreading rapidly and causing significant losses. Manual disease identification across large farms is arduous and time-consuming. Leveraging computer vision for early disease detection and classification can mitigate up to 90% of production losses. This study collected leaves from two regions of Bangladesh, categorized as healthy, leaf rust-affected, and leaf spot-affected. With a total of 1091 images, split into training (764), testing (218), and validation (109) sets for 5-fold cross-validation, preprocessing and augmentation yielded 6,000 images, including synthetics. This study compares ResNet50, VGG19, and MobileNetV3Small on a specific task following architecture modifications. Four convolutional layers with different output channels (512, 128, 64, and 32) were added to baseline models. We assessed how these architectural changes affected model correctness, computing efficiency, and convergence rates. Comparing three pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50, and VGG19 - augmented with four additional layers, the modified MobileNetV3Small excelled in precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, achieving notable results of 97.0%, 96.4%, 96.4%, and 96.4%, respectively, across cross-validation folds. An efficient smartphone application employing the proposed model for mulberry leaf disease recognition was developed. Overall, the model outperformed existing State of the Art (SOTA) approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in disease identification. The interpretative Grad-CAM visualization images match sericulture specialists' assessments, validating the model's predictions. These results imply that, this eXplainable AI (XAI) approach with a modified deep learning architecture can appropriately classify mulberry leaves. © 2013 IEEE.","AI-enabled mobile application; modified MobileNetV3Small; Mulberry leaf disease; plant disease detection; transfer learning","Convolution; Neural networks; Plants (botany); AI-enabled mobile application; Computational modelling; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Leaf disease; Mobile applications; Mulberry leaf disease; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Transfer learning; Animals","","","","","","","Sanchez-Salcedo E.M., Mena P., Garcia-Viguera C., Martinez J.J., Hernandez F., Phytochemical evaluation of white (Morus alba L.) and black (Morus nigra L.) mulberry fruits, a starting point for the assessment of their beneficial properties, J.

This study aimed to investigate the use of deep convolutional neural networks for the real-time identification of diseases in tomato plant leaves. A customized field dataset was constructed, consisting of several images of tomato leaves captured using a mobile phone from agricultural fields in the Kerala and Tamil Nadu regions and classified into two categories: healthy and diseased. A YOLO v5 deep learning model was trained to classify images of tomato leaves into the respective categories. This study aimed to determine the most effective hyperparameters for the classification and detection of healthy and sick leaves sections, using both proprietary and publicly available datasets. The YOLO v5 model demonstrated a notable accuracy rate of 93% when evaluated in the test dataset. This method can help farmers quickly recognize diseased leaves and prompt the implementation of preventive measures to curtail the spread of tomato plant diseases. © 2023, Dr D. Pylarinos.

The mentioned research paper is about an original technique for the multiclass classification of groundnut disease using fine-tuned InceptionV3 model. Groundnut, a key crop for both nutrition and economic aspects, is vulnerable to multiple diseases such as Early Leaf Spot, Late Leaf Spot, Rust, and Groundnut Rosette Disease; each of which has an intense effect on crop yields. Using groundnut plant leaf images as a base for a comprehensive dataset, this study finetunes the InceptionV3 model, pre-fed on ImageNet, to perform more precise differentiations between healthy and diseased leaves. The methodology that has been used includes dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, and model training by using training and validation datasets and relying on standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Data confirms the model's accuracy in disease categorization and that it is much more efficient than routine and manual approaches. This study pragmatically points out the prospects of deep learning in improving agricultural management systems and also encourages extensive research of different forms of AI for diagnostics applications. © 2024 IEEE.","Automated Disease Classification; Deep Learning; Fine-tuning; Groundnut Leaf Diseases; Image Recognition; InceptionV3 Model; Precision Agriculture","Automated disease classification; Crop yield; Deep learning; Disease classification; Fine tuning; Groundnut leaf disease; Inceptionv3 model; Leaf disease; Multi-class classification; Precision Agriculture; Deep learning","","","","","","","Gupta A., Kumar B., Deep Learning for Plant Diseases: Challenges and Opportunities, Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1578-1587, (2019); Patel R., Jain S., InceptionV3: Advancements in Image Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41, 6, pp. 1389-1402, (2020); Zhang L., Wang M., Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Agricultural Disease Detection, Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Big Data, pp. 2053-2060, (2018); Yadav S.K., Mishra A., Automated Detection of Groundnut Leaf Diseases Using Deep Learning, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 115987-115996, (2019); Mehta S., Kukreja V., Gupta R., Empowering Precision Agriculture: Detecting Apple Leaf Diseases and Severity Levels with Federated Learning CNN, 2023 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Technologies (CONIT), pp. 1-6, (2023); Li T., Zhang H., A Comparative Study on Fine-Tuning Deep Learning Models for Plant Disease Identification, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, pp. 6873-6888, (2020); Khan M.S., Tiwari J.P., Early and Late Leaf Spot Detection in Groundnut Using Image Processing Techniques, Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Agricultural Engineering, pp. 1024-1031, (2020); Sakshi, Kukreja V., Recent trends in mathematical expressions recognition: An LDA-based analysis, Expert Syst.

Plant disease is one of the prime factors that impact crop yield. The disease impacts all parts of plants such as leaves, roots, and stems. Farmers waste most of their energy, time, and effort dealing with it manually and lead to heavy loss in the yield of the crops. Mango production is affected by several types of diseases. Prior recognition of disease would ease and reduce the diagnostic process that enhances the production of quality crops. A huge investigation has been carried out in the field of identifying and classifying leaf disease. Hence, an appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) based solution is needed to support farmers. The objective of the work is to provide an effective and efficient AI-based solution to detect and classify leaf disease earlier. Earlier disease detection in crops is the most prominent way to prevent loss of money and time. The plant leaf image is mainly used as a source to detect disease in the plant. This paper employs an ensemble stacked deep learning model to resolve the problem of automatic identification of mango-leaf diseases. In the proposed approach, initially, the images are segmented for the region of interest and input to a stack of various deep neural networks. The outcome of the deep neural network is aggregated with a machine learning model to identify leaf disease. This model is used to identify various mango leaf diseases such as Powdery mildew, Anthracnose, etc. In the experiment, the deep learning models are stacked and aggregated with machine learning to identify mango leaf diseases.

In routine implementation, the identification of diseases is realized either by manual or laboratory testing. Physical testing involves few expertise and results could vary from individuals which can result in false interpretation while the latter requires extra time and might not be able to deliver the production, due to which the spread of disease gradually increases. Hence an automated system is required for the identification and classification of the disease. This chapter intends leaf sickness detection and recognition by applying deep learning for two data split ratios. The classification task is performed using Alex-net, a pre-trained architecture. The data set has three categories of leaf disease, namely, bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, and leaf blast, each consisting of 40 infected images. The proposed architecture classifies the diseases into three categories. The comparison study for various performance metrics-such as recall, precision, and specificity-is measured. © 2024, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Ahmed K., Shahidi T.R., Alam S.M.I., Momen S., Rice leaf disease detection using machine learning techniques, 2019 International Conference on Sustainable Technologies for Industry 4.0 (STI), pp. 1-5, (2019); Anthimopoulos M., Christodoulidis S., Ebner L., Christe A., Mougiakakou S., Lung pattern classification for interstitial lung diseases using a deep convolutional neural network, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 35, 5, pp. 1207-1216, (2016); Archana K.S., Sahayadhas A., Automatic rice leaf disease segmentation using image processing techniques, Int.

Tea production plays an essential role, among the oldest and most globally consumed beverages. Diseases in tea plants are quite prevalent and significantly contribute to crop losses. Detecting plant leaf diseases stands as a pivotal concern in agriculture, aiming to enhance crop yields and overall production. Hence, the automated identification of leaf diseases, employing deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), and transfer learning models play a major role in automated feature extraction and classification. To enhance the accuracy of disease recognition, this study proposes a CNN model for identifying tea leaf diseases. The experiment conducted on the collected dataset from Kaggle demonstrates that by utilizing batch sizes of 64 and running for 20 epochs, the tea leaf disease identification model achieves the highest accuracy of 99.86% and a minimal loss of 0.0077. These results validate the effectiveness of this study and hold profound theoretical and practical significance in advancing the field of intelligent agriculture by incorporating the optimal deep learning model for disease identification. © 2023 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; image processing; machine learning; tea leaf diseases","Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Images processing; Leaf disease; Learning models; Machine-learning; Neural network model; Tea leaf disease; Tea-leaves; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Hu G., Yang X., Zhang Y., Wan M., Identification of tea leaf diseases by using an improved deep convolutional neural network, Sustain.

However, global warming, climate change, and other essential elements, such as pests, have a negative impact on spinach growth and produce many diseases that limit and destroy the production of healthy crops, making early and correct identification of these diseases critical. Many studies in recent years have employed deep learning models to automatically diagnose vegetable leaf diseases. However, many of these methods are based on separate deep learning architectures, ignoring the different effects of different channels and spatial location relationships in the feature map on classification, resulting in insufficient image representation. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated deep learning system for automatic recognition of spinach leaf disease. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to repeatedly train and extract important features from shallow layers to enhance the recognition of the network. Second, a novel spatial attention mechanism is introduced, which decomposes the two-dimensional space into horizontal and vertical dimensions. While paying attention to the local area, the attention weight can be mapped to the adjacent position of the lesion area, providing rich features for the model. Finally, the outer product matrix of the attention mechanism is kerneled to model the nonlinear relationship between channels using a Sigmoid kernel function, and the final classification is completed by a softmax layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the correct classification rate is 95.12 on our test set. This finding demonstrates the reliability of the proposed hybrid model as an automatic identifier of spinach plant diseases, which can significantly contribute to providing better solutions for identifying other crop diseases in the agricultural field. © Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology 2024.","Deep learning; Spatial attention mechanism; Spinach leaf; Vegetable disease","","","","","","","","Albahar M., A survey on deep learning and its impact on agriculture: challenges and opportunities, Agric-Basel, (2023); Avgerinos C., Vretos N., Daras P., Less is more: adaptive trainable gradient dropout for deep neural networks, Sensors, (2023); Dang M., Wang H., Li Y., Nguyen T., Tightiz L., Xuan-Mung N., Nguyen T., Computer vision for plant disease recognition: a comprehensive review, Bot Rev, (2024); Ding W., Abdel-Basset M., Alrashdi I., Hawash H., Next generation of computer vision for plant disease monitoring in precision agriculture: a contemporary survey, taxonomy, experiments, and future direction, Inf Sci, (2024); Faisal M., Leu J.S., Avian C., Prakosa S.W., Koppen M., DFNet: dense fusion convolution neural network for plant leaf disease classification, Agron J, (2023); Gao Y.X., Cao Z.Z., Cai W.W., Gong G.F., Zhou G.X., Li L.J., apple leaf disease identification in complex background based on BAM-Net, Agron-Basel, 13, 5, pp. 1-23, (2023); Gong Q., Kang W., Fahroo F., Approximation of compositional functions with ReLU neural networks, Syst Control Lett, (2023); Hu Z., Zhang J., Ge Y., Handling vanishing gradient problem using artificial derivative, IEEE ACCESS, 9, pp. 22371-22377, (2021); Ibrahim R., Shafiq M.O., Explainable convolutional neural networks: a taxonomy, review, and future directions, ACM Comput Surv, 55, 10, pp. 1-37, (2023); Jafar A., Bibi N., Naqvi R., Sadeghi-Niaraki A., Jeong D., Revolutionizing agriculture with artificial intelligence: plant disease detection methods, applications, and their limitations, Front Plant Sci, (2024); Liu K.C., Zhang X.J., PiTLiD: identification of plant disease from leaf images based on convolutional neural network, IEEE-ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform, (2023); Liu X.N., Ghazali K.H., Han F.R., Mohamed I.I., Review of CNN in aerial image processing, Imaging Sci J, (2023); Mulindwa D.B., Du S.Z., An n-sigmoid activation function to improve the squeeze-and-excitation for 2D and 3D deep networks, Electronics, 12, 4, pp. 1-20, (2023); Najafabadi M.Y., Hesami M., Eskandari M., Machine learning-assisted approaches in modernized plant breeding programs, Genes, 14, 4, pp. 1-23, (2023); Ni J.G., Zhou Z.G., Zhao Y.F., Han Z.Z., Zhao L.G., Tomato leaf disease recognition based on improved convolutional neural network with attention mechanism, Plant Pathol, (2023); Ofuya T.I., Okunlola A.I., A review of insect pest management in vegetable crop production in Nigeria, InSects, 14, 2, pp. 1-17, (2023); Ramya R., Kumar P., High-performance deep transfer learning model with batch normalization based on multiscale feature fusion for tomato plant disease identification and categorization, Environ Res Commun, (2023); Shafique S., Mubarak A., Shafique S., Hussain A., Aspergillus aculeatus a novel leaf spot pathogen of spinach Oleraceae from Pakistan, J Anim Plant SciJaps, 33, 1, pp. 103-109, (2023); Ullah Z., Alsubaie N., Jamjoom M., Alajmani S.H., Saleem F., EffiMob-Net: a deep learning-based hybrid model for detection and identification of tomato diseases using leaf images, Agric-Basel, 13, 3, pp. 1-14, (2023); Yuliandra T., Touvleliou K., Botre F., Loke S., Isenmann E., Valder S., Diel P., Parr M.K., Urinary excretion of ecdysterone and its metabolites following spinach consumption, Mol Nutr Food Res, (2023); Zhao L., Walkowiak S., Fernando W.G.D., Artificial intelligence: a promising tool in exploring the phytomicrobiome in managing disease and promoting plant health, Plants-Basel, (2023)","L.

This research uses a large dataset gathered from many sources, such as agricultural universities, research centres, and first hand field observations, to provide a unique method of diagnosing Rice Sheath Rot disease using cutting-edge deep learning algorithms. Our work is primarily focused on creating a dependable and effective diagnostic tool using state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning methods. Wavelet filters are applied in the first step of our approach to pre-process photos. This method is essential for eliminating noise and improving the quality of the dataset, which is made up of high-definition photos of rice plants with the disease Sheath Rot. The colour, shape, and texture of the sick spots are then analyzed using advanced feature extraction techniques. When separating plant tissues that are diseased from those that are not, these characteristics are essential. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our primary diagnostic model's foundation, were selected due to their shown efficacy in picture recognition and classification applications. The preprocessed and feature-enhanced dataset is used to train the CNN model, giving it the ability to recognize the complex patterns and traits connected to Sheath Rot illness. The architecture of the model is built to maximize efficiency and accuracy, guaranteeing quick and accurate illness identification. By utilizing AI and deep learning, the proposed method seeks to not only help farmers and agronomists identify diseases early on but also make a substantial contribution to the area of agricultural disease diagnostics. Combine that our method, which combines CNN-based analysis with wavelet-filtered pre-processing establishes a new standard for the identification and treatment of Rice Sheath Rot disease. This might result in improved crop management techniques and more potent disease control tactics.  © 2024 IEEE.","CNN; Data Fusion; Deep Learning; Rice; Sheath Rot Disease","Combines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Feature extraction and analysis; Food crops; Large datasets; Research use; Rice; Rice sheath rot; Rot disease; Sheath rot disease; Image enhancement","","","","","","","Musonerimana S., Bez C., Licastro D., Habarugira G., Bigirimana J., Venturi V., Pathobiomes Revealed that Pseudomonas fuscovaginae and Sarocladium oryzae Are Independently Associated with Rice Sheath Rot, Microbial Ecology, 80, 3, pp. 627-642, (2020); Md.

In recent years, there has been an increasing use of deep learning techniques for the recognition of plant diseases. However, persistent challenges such as the limited availability of comprehensive datasets and the need to improve recognition accuracy still exist in tea disease identification. To address these issues, we collect a small-scale tea disease image dataset, containing 203 images covering six common tea disease. Then, we proposed a two-stage transfer learning approach for improving the accuracy. Firstly, we modified the first stage in ResNet50 to better extracting image feature. Next, we leverage a two-stage transfer learning approach which first transfers to a related intermediate PlantVillage dataset. The proposed model achieved a recognition accuracy of 87.67% when trained from scratch on the tea leaf dataset, which is 5.46% higher than the ResNet50 model. Furthermore, the two-stage transfer algorithm can further improve the recognition accuracy to 90.64%.  © 2023 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Fine-grained Image Classification; Transfer Learning","Deep learning; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Deep learning; Fine grained; Fine-grained image classification; Human expertise; Images classification; Learning approach; Learning techniques; Recognition accuracy; Transfer learning; Transfer learning methods; Image classification","","","","","Fujian Key Laboratory of Big Data Application and Intellectualization for Tea Industry, Wuyi University, (FKLBDAITI202203)","The Open Project Program of Fujian Key Laboratory of Big Data Application and Intellectualization for Tea Industry, Wuyi University (No. FKLBDAITI202203).","Serafini M., Del Rio D., Yao D., Bettuzzi S., Peluso I., Health Benefits of Tea, (2012); Feng J., Tang H., Chen D., Li L., Monitoring and risk assessment of pesticide residues in tea samples from China, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 21, 1, pp. 169-183, (2015); Bruno A., Moroni D., Dainelli R., Rocchi L., Morelli S., Ferrari E., Toscano P., Martinelli M., Improving plant disease classification by adaptive minimal ensembling, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 5, (2022); Nitzan Y., Gal R., Brenner O., Cohen-Or D., Large: Latent-based regression through gan semantics, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 19239-19249, (2022); Olaniyi E., Chen D., Lu Y., Huang Y., Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Augmentation in Agriculture: A Systematic Review, (2022); Noyan M.A., Uncovering Bias in the Plantvillage Dataset, (2022); Hu G., Yang X., Zhang Y., Wan M., Identification of tea leaf diseases by using an improved deep convolutional neural network, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 24, (2019); Soeb M.J.A., Jubayer M.F., Tarin T.A., Al Mamun M.R., Ruhad F.M., Parven A., Mubarak N.M., Karri S.L., Meftaul I.M., Tea leaf disease detection and identification based on yolov7 (yolo-t, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Hughes D., Salathe M., Et al., An Open Access Repository of Images on Plant Health to Enable the Development of Mobile Disease Diagnostics, (2015); He K., Zhang X., Ren S., Sun J., Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Chen M., Tang Y., Zou X., Huang K., Huang Z., Zhou H., Wang C., Lian G., Three-dimensional perception of orchard banana central stock enhanced by adaptive multi-vision technology, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 174, (2020); Li Q., Jia W., Sun M., Hou S., Zheng Y., A novel green apple segmentation algorithm based on ensemble u-net under complex orchard environment, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 180, (2021); Jiang P., Chen Y., Liu B., He D., Liang C., Real-time detection of apple leaf diseases using deep learning approach based on improved convolutional neural networks, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 59069-59080, (2019); Xiang S., Liang Q., Sun W., Zhang D., Wang Y., L-csms: Novel lightweight network for plant disease severity recognition, Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection, 128, pp. 557-569, (2021); Tan L., Lu J., Jiang H., Tomato leaf diseases classification based on leaf images: A comparison between classical machine learning and deep learning methods, AgriEngineering, 3, 3, pp. 542-558, (2021); Mishra M., Choudhury P., Pati B., Modified ride-nn optimizer for the iot based plant disease detection, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 12, pp. 691-703, (2021); Schuler J.P.S., Romani S., Abdel-Nasser M., Rashwan H., Puig D., Color-aware two-branch dcnn for efficient plant disease classification, Mendel, 28, 1, pp. 55-62, (2022); Ghiasi G., Lin T.-Y., Le Q.V., Dropblock: A regularization method for convolutional networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 31, (2018); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, (2014); Dosovitskiy A., Beyer L., Kolesnikov A., Weissenborn D., Zhai X., Unterthiner T., Dehghani M., Minderer M., Heigold G., Gelly S., Et al., An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale.

To address issues such as low segmentation accuracy in plant leaf images amidst complex backgrounds, inadequacies in recognition and detection models, insufficient data sets, and sluggish training speed, we propose a method for potato leaf image segmentation and recognition based on an enhanced DeeplabV3+ network. Specifically, we substitute the model encoder's backbone feature extraction network with MobileNetV2 to significantly reduce computational requirements while enhancing calculation speed. Then, the attention mechanism module was incorporated into the backbone feature extraction network and decoder to further enhance the model's edge recognition capability and improve its segmentation accuracy. Simultaneously, this study devised a classification model to achieve potato leaf disease segmentation and detection amidst complex backgrounds. In the initial stage, an enhanced DeeplabV3+ was employed for segmenting potato leaves in intricate environments. Subsequently, ResNet101, ResNet50, and ShuffleNetV2 classification models were utilized in the second stage for accurately classifying potato leaves.

This identification process has changed drastically, moving in the direction of digitalization and data-driven techniques, due to the rapid advancement of technology in farming. As a result of this development, smart farming can incorporate complex analytical tools, strategic planning, and decision-making support systems. A major step forward in contemporary farming is the digitization and data-driven revolution in plant disease detection. Sustainable agriculture in the face of complicated environmental difficulties is possible when farmers use technology and data to their advantage in the fight against diseases. This will increase crop yields while decreasing losses. The present research study presents an innovative framework designed to improve the detection and recognition of plant diseases by utilizing deep learning techniques. This framework is specifically created to enhance the precision, comprehensiveness, and effectiveness of diagnosing plant diseases in agricultural environments. At first, the framework utilises a region proposal network (RPN) to accurately identify and locate leaves in challenging environmental conditions. This phase is essential for separating the pertinent sections of the image for further investigation. After localizing the leaves, the images are inputted into a classification system, such as a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) known as MobileNet-V2, to identify and recognize diseases. The execution of this framework yielded highly accurate findings, with an impressive accuracy rate of 97.97%. The level of precision exceeds that of conventional techniques, demonstrating a substantial enhancement in illness detection capability. The suggested framework effectively reduces the negative effects of plant diseases on agricultural production, leading to sustainable development in agriculture.The implementation of deep learning algorithms, as suggested in this study paper, has significant implications in diverse fields such as intelligent agriculture, ecological conservation, and agricultural efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; MobileNet-V2; region proposal network","Convolutional neural networks; Agricultural environments; Agricultural sustainability; Analytical tool; Convolutional neural network; Data driven technique; Disease detection; Identification process; Mobilenet-v2; Plant disease; Region proposal network; Smart agriculture","","","","","","","Kumar P., Projection of Plant Leaf Disease Using Support Vector Machine Algorithm, 2023 ICRASET, pp. 1-6, (2023); Sheriff M.A., A Comparative Analysis on the Prediction of Heart Failure using Machine Learning Algorithms, 2024 ICMCSI, pp. 206-211, (2024); SenthilPandi S., Senthilselvi A., Kumaragurubaran T., Dhanasekaran S., Self-attention-based generative adversarial network optimized with color harmony algorithm for brain tumor classification, Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine, (2024); Predictive Modelling of Critical Vital Signs in ICU Patients by Machine Learning: An Early Warning System for Improved Patient Outcomes, 2024 3rd International Conference for Innovation in Technology (INOCON), pp. 1-6, (2024); Gopi S.C., Kondaveeti H.K., Transfer Learning for Rice Leaf Disease Detection, 2023 Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Energy (ICAIS), pp. 509-515; Tumpa S.B., Halder K.K., A Comparative Study on Different Transfer Learning Approaches for Identification of Plant Diseases, 2023 International Conference on Next-Generation Computing, IoT and Machine Learning (NCIM), pp. 1-6, (2023); Kaushik A., Mittal N., Plant Disease Recognition (Integrating Deep Learning for Accurate Diagnosis and Sustainable Agriculture), 2024 11th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO), pp. 1-6; Pantazi X.E., Moshou D., Tamouridou A.A., Kasderidis S., Leaf disease recognition in vine plants based on local binary patterns and one class support vector machines, Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations: 12th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference and Workshops, AIAI 2016, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 16-18, 2016, Proceedings, 12, pp. 319-327, (2016); Ding N., Chen Y., Cui G., Wang X., Zheng H.T., Liu Z., Xie P., Few-shot Classification with Hypersphere Modeling of Prototypes, (2022); Senthil Pandi S., Monesh M.S., Lingesh B., A Novel Approach to Detect Face Fraud Detection Using Artificial Intelligence, 2024 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering (ICETITE), pp. 1-6, (2024); SenthilPandi S., Chiranjeevi V.R., Multi-Level Interpretable and Adaptive Representation of EEG Signals for Sleep Scoring Using Ensemble Learning Multi Classifiers, 2023 RMKMATE, pp. 1-6, (2023)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd IEEE International Conference on Advances in Information Technology, ICAIT 2024","24 July 2024 through 27 July 2024","Chikkamagaluru, Karnataka","203115","","979-835038386-7","","","English","IEEE Int.

Early crop disease identification, using reliable or automated detection methods, can boost food output while decreasing financial losses. Deep learning has significantly improved the identification precision of picture classification and object recognition systems in recent years. As a result, in this research, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used to swiftly identify plant illnesses. The focus of the suggested model was on enhancing the hyper parameters of well-known pre-trained models like Mobile Net, ResNet-152, VGG-19, and Inception v3. The suggested model makes use of the ResNet152 architecture and intricate hidden layers tuned using random search tuning methods on the real-time dataset of banana leaf capture. Classification precision, recall, accuracy, and F1_score were used to assess the suggested model’s efficiency. There was also a comparison with other cutting-edge investigations.

If plant diseases are not recognized in a prompt way, food insecurity will rise, affecting the country's income. Plant disease identification is critical for successful crop prevention and control of diseases, as well as farm production management and decision-making. Plant disease detection technologies aid in finding infected plants in their early phases and also help the user in cost-effectively expanding plant disease identification system to a variety of plants. This paper's major contribution is a stacked ensemble technique based on Machine learning and Deep learning techniques. This research article also elaborates on how plant disease detection framework will be realized using novel segmentation and feature extraction strategies for extracting significant features for classification. Once the features are extracted, they are transmitted to the cloud platform to implement web enabled automated monitoring system. The proposed stacked ensemble learning is evaluated by comparing different machine learning and Deep learning techniques models utilizing precision, recall, and F_score. When compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques approaches, the findings show that the proposed technique achieves about 99% accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Classification;

The millions of living organisms, including plants and animals, are kept in balance with one another by many ecological processes, such as plant diseases, which are a recurrent aspect of nature. The subfield of computer vision, object recognition, has made substantial progress in recent years. Convolutional neural networks are deep learning network architecture trains using data in a hands-on manner. Our primary emphasis was making minute adjustments to the hyperparameters of well-known pre-trained models, including DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. This study presented a convolutional neural network model for detecting and identifying plant leaf diseases based on visual data to boost accuracy, generality, and the overall efficacy of training. The outcome of the suggested model evaluates next to the results of other models. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed convolutional neural network-based model worked better than other models and achieved a classification accuracy of 99.23% higher. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

In this study, diseased tomato leaves were used as the research object and fine-grained feature learning of diseases was performed using a deep-learning method to achieve tomato disease degree detection. The proposed model uses ResNet-50 as the backbone network, and the object positioning, destruction and reassembly, and attention area division modules are built on it. Without adding parameters or further boundary annotation, the object positioning module could reliably predict the location of lesions. By erasing the contextual semantic data, the proposed destruction and reassembly module learns more granular features. The attention area division module is capable of localizing the lesion positions, thereby enhancing the recognition accuracy. The results of the study indicate that the proposed model performed better than state-of-the-art methods in identifying the extent of tomato diseases, and achieved an accuracy of 95.03%. The accuracy in identifying the types of tomato diseases is 98.25%. Concludingly, the proposed model is competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches for identifying the severity of tomato diseases and provides a novel model for identifying the degrees of plant diseases. © 2023","Deep learning;

The prevalence of rice infections poses a significant challenge to farmers, impacting crop yield and resulting in substantial losses. Human identification of diseases relies on expertise, making early diagnosis crucial for sustaining rice plant health. To address the limited number of rice leaf images in the database, our approach incorporates augmentation and dilation rate. Integrating drone technology and machine learning algorithms offers a promising solution to efficiently diagnose rice leaf diseases. However, existing methods face challenges such as picture backgrounds, insufficient field image data, and symptom variations. This work introduces a robust methodology, leveraging a specialized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for rice leaf photos, effectively enhancing disease classification accuracy. The proposed approach successfully identifies and diagnoses three distinct classes: leaf smut, brown spot, and bacterial leaf blight. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

On top of that, there was an enormous spike in this quantity, hitting near 35.91 million tonnes for the fiscal year 2022-23. The substantial increase in corn production in India is driven by government efforts to boost ethanol production and demand in the poultry industry. Corn production has encountered a variety of issues, such as Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, and Cercospora Leaf Spot infections, which have had an unfavorable impact on socioeconomic situations. Approaches based on deep learning elevate corn production by utilizing image recognition and predictive analytics to detect and control diseases at an early stage. Additionally, it assists in the development of maize varieties that are resistant to diseases, leading to increased yield and sustainability with the limitation for an accurate classification model. This study introduces DenseViT, a deep learning model combining Vision Transformer (ViT) and DenseNet121, a model which can accurate classify corn leaf diseases, trained and evaluated on 4,354 images of 4 types of corn leaves from the PlantVillage dataset. The DenseViT model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.85%, with precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98.18%, 98.17%, and 98.17%, respectively.

In this study, we have proposed an object detection approach with help of You Only Look Once (YOLO) detection methods to determine and diagnose multiple diseases. Our system is designed to identify and classify numerous plant leaf diseases accurately and reliably. The dataset of plant leaves was manually annotated to meet the model's training requirements. The object detection model is trained to recognize the presence or absence of plant diseases using the annotated dataset. Our proposed system takes a full image of a plant leaf in a single instant and predicts bounding boxes and class probability. Farmers can use their mobile phones to capture a random picture of a plant leaf, and our model can detect and identify the disease present in the leaf, helping them take the necessary steps to prevent disease spread. Our system is especially useful for farmers who can identify plant diseases as soon as they appear and take measures to prevent their spread, resulting in higher crop yields and better crop quality.

Thus, the early stage of identification is necessary to control and alleviate the influences of pest attacks. The common disease affecting in rice is brown spot (BS). Most of the previous methods used image recognition techniques and machine-driven disease diagnosis systems to detect the crop diseases. However, these techniques are not feasible to process lots of images, time-consuming, inaccurate, and expensive. Hence, an effective approach, named shuffled Shepherd social political optimization algorithm (SSSPOA) based deep learning is developed for rice leaf infection categorization and severity percentage detection. The developed SSSPOA is the merging of shuffled shepherd social optimization (SSSO) and political optimizer (PO). Here, the input image is pre-processed by using the RoI extraction method to eliminate the unwanted noise from the image. Then, the segmentation process is done by using the DFC technique. Deep maxout network (DMN) is adopted for grading the leaf diseases into blast, bacterial blight, tungro, and BS where the training step of DMN is conducted utilizing designed SSSPOA. In addition, forecasting of severity percentage takes place using deep long short-term memory (LSTM) by taking segmented values such that the tuning mechanism of deep LSTM is done utilizing the same SSSPOA. Therefore, the presented strategy outperformed different conventional models and achieved efficient performance with a higher testing accuracy of 0.954, a sensitivity of 0.987, a specificity of 0.965, a lower mean square error (MSE) of 0.076, and a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.275, respectively.  © 2024 National Taiwan University.","Deep long short-term memory;

The key to prevent the loss of yield of plant crops is the identification of plant diseases. The process of monitor plant health manually is challenging as it required expert knowledge which is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, the image processing techniques can be useful for the detection and classification of plant leaf disease. In this project, the leaf images of 5 plant types in the PlantVillage dataset are used for plant type and plant disease classification. The original images are resized to the required input sized and the proposed background removal methods (improved HSV and GrabCut segmentation) are performed to reduce the background noise. The segmented images are then given to proposed models (AlexNet and DenseNet121) for training and classification. For plant type classification, DenseNet121 got a better validation accuracy of 99% compared to AlexNet with 91.2%.

Fast and efficient identification can greatly reduce the natural, economic, and human resource loss caused to agricultural practitioners. Deep neural networks allow computers to learn plant disease detection in an end-to-end manner, thereby obtaining better results and higher efficiency. While Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have become a well-established tool for detecting plant diseases, the lack of robustness of the models due to environmental variations remains to be a critical concern. Recent research into overcoming this challenge includes domain adaptation (DA) algorithms like classic Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) or the innovative Multi-Representation Subdomain Adaptation Network with Uncertainty Regularization for Cross-Species Plant Disease Classification (MSUN). However, the topic remains under-explored as the newly developed methods were not tested on many crop species and diseases. This research focuses on four deep CNN models (MobileNet, VGG, GoogLenet, and ResNet). The models are developed and tested using the New Plant Diseases dataset on Kaggle, which comprises 70,000+ training images (offline- augmented) and 17,000+ validation images encompassing 38 different classes of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The models would be cross-evaluated upon their accuracy and training speed, as well as their change in performance after optimization and applying DA methods. With an uppermost accuracy of 86.4% in test dataset from the wild, results show that Transfer Learning, Model Ensemble as well as Domain Adaptation works effectively to increase the robustness of models which will ultimately benefit farmers in detecting plant diseases and deciding on the best treatment in real-time. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, some farmers are not experts in properly identifying pests to control them effectively and efficiently, so they have to rely on expert diagnosticians who are often unavailable. Therefore, this study aims to create a mobile application that can identify corn pests based on their morphological characteristics and damage patterns. The researchers trained and compared different state-of-the-art mobile Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures with the Transfer Learning method where the pretrained CNN models were fine-tuned to classify corn leaf diseases and insect pests. Through the comparative analysis, this study provides insights into the performance and suitability of the ten mobile CNNs for mobile application use for corn leaf disease and insect pest classification. During the recognition of plant leaf diseases, the GhostNet model achieved the highest accuracy average of 97.78%, and the MixNet model for the classification of insect pests, with the highest accuracy average of 92.76%, signifies that these models can be used to reliably identify corn pests. The performance of these models exhibits high accuracy and efficient inference times, making them well-suited for on-device processing. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","Insect pests; Leaf diseases; Mobile convolutional neural network (CNN); Transfer learning","","","","","","","","Volume of Corn Production in Central Luzon Second Quarter 2021, (2021); Philippine Yellow Corn Industry Road Map 2021-2040, (2022); Miraflor M., Corn importation now a necessity, Manila Bulletin, (2021); Integrated Pest Management, (2014); Navasero M.B., Et al., Detection of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.

The use of deep learning techniques for plant disease category detection prevents further spread of the disease and helps to prevent crop production losses. In this paper, Based on the Next-Vit neural network model, we proposed a lightweight neural network CAST-Net based on the combination of convolution and self-attention, and we adopted self-distillation based on this model to achieve increased accuracy in classifying plant leaf diseases while reducing the number of model parameters and flops. Our model and method achieved 98.4% accuracy on the tomato subset of the data-enhanced PlantVillage dataset, a 4.9% improvement over the Next-Vit model, and 99.0% accuracy on the full PlantVillage set, a 6.9% improvement over the Next-Vit model. We also propose a new dynamic learning rate function that is applied to the training phase to prevent the loss from reaching the optimal value. The results show that our model and method have higher accuracy, fewer parameters, shorter training time and lower computational complexity than existing models. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","CAST-Net; Dynamic learning rate function; Lightweight neural network; Plant disease classification; Self-distillation","artificial neural network; complexity; crop production; disease resistance; recognition","","","","","","","Alguliyev R., Imamverdiyev Y., Sukhostat L., Bayramov R., Plant disease detection based on a deep model, Soft Comput., 25, pp. 13229-13242, (2021); Alshammari H., Gasmi K., Krichen M., Ammar L.B., Abdelhadi M.O., Boukrara A., Mahmood M.A., Optimal deep learning model for olive disease diagnosis based on an adaptive genetic algorithm, Wireless Commun.

Today, it is adopted in many different applications, such as object recognition, object classification, and medical purposes. This research aimed to use deep convolutional neural networks for the real-time detection of diseases in plant leaves. Typically, farmers are unaware of diseases on plant leaves and adopt manual disease detection methods. Their production often decreases as the virus spreads. However, due to a lack of essential infrastructure, quick identification needs to be improved in many regions of the world. It is now feasible to diagnose diseases using mobile devices as a result of the increase in mobile phone usage globally and recent advancements in computer vision due to deep learning. To conduct this research, firstly, a dataset was created that contained images of money plant leaves that had been split into two primary categories, specifically (i) healthy and (ii) unhealthy. This research collected thousands of images in a controlled environment and used a public dataset with exact dimensions. The next step was to train a deep model to identify healthy and unhealthy leaves. Our trained YOLOv5 model was applied to determine the spots on the exclusive and public datasets. This research quickly and accurately identified even a small patch of disease with the help of YOLOv5. It captured the entire image in one shot and forecasted adjacent boxes and class certainty. A random dataset image served as the model’s input via a cell phone. This research is beneficial for farmers since it allows them to recognize diseased leaves as soon as they noted and take the necessary precautions to halt the disease’s spread. This research aimed to provide the best hyper-parameters for classifying and detecting the healthy and unhealthy parts of leaves in exclusive and public datasets. Our trained YOLOv5 model achieves 93 % accuracy on a test set. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; object detection; plant health detection; precision agriculture; YOLOv5","","","","","","","","Ferentinos K.P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Comput.

Box 4000, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia","Plant diseases pose the greatest threat to food supply integrity, and it is a significant challenge to identify plant diseases in their earliest stages to reduce the potential for associated economic damage. Through the use of computer vision, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence is offered as a solution to this problem so that tomato leaf diseases may be classified. The proposed network is expected to provide excellent results. Transfer learning is also used to make the model efficient and cost effective. Since tomato diseases may significantly influence crop output and quality, early identification and diagnosis of these diseases are essential for successful treatment. Deep learning has shown a great deal of promise in plant disease identification, providing excellent accuracy and efficiency. In this investigation, we compared the performance of three different deep learning models—DenseNet169, ResNet50V2, and a transform model, namely ViT, with regard to diagnosing diseases affecting tomatoes. Both diseased and healthy tomato samples were included in the dataset of photos of tomato diseases used for training and testing the models. The DenseNet121 model had the best results, with a training accuracy of (99.88%) and a testing accuracy of (99.00%). This gave it the greatest overall accuracy. Both the ResNet50V2 and VIT models attained high levels of accuracy, with testing accuracies of (95.60% and 98.00%), respectively. Our results demonstrate deep learning’s potential for accurate and efficient tomato disease detection, which could aid in early disease management and ultimately improve crop yield and quality. The experimental findings show that the suggested ensemble models stand out due to the short amount of time required for training and testing as well as their exceptional classification performances. Because of this study, professionals will be able to facilitate the early diagnosis of plant diseases in a straightforward and expedient way, thereby preventing the emergence of new infections. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; deep leaning; food security; plant diseases; transform learning","","","","","","Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, (INST048)","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number INST048.","Schreinemachers P., Simmons E.B., Wopereis M.C., Tapping the economic and nutritional power of vegetables, Glob.

As agriculture struggles to support the rapidly growing global population, various agricultural problems such as plant disease detection/recognition, weed detection, environmental prediction, seed quality prediction, seed classification and animal intrusion detection are the major threats to crop production and quality of food. Early diagnosis and identification of such problems can be helpful for the farmers to prevent the loss in crop yield and quantity of crop production. The above mentioned agricultural problems which require a monitoring mechanism is one of the recent research topics in the agricultural field. The recognition and classification of agricultural plant diseases, seed classification, animal/bird intrusion detection, pest detection, weed detection by utilizing the deep learning techniques which is used to analyze and learn about differential features in a very stratified way will minimize risks related to crop protection. IoT based machine learning approach for Smart farming is used for environmental impact, agricultural production, food security and sustainability. A huge demand for food production must be achieved while the population is growing rapidly. Food security will be ensured by sustainable farming procedures. Emerging ICT technologies such as IoT, computer vision, cloud computing, big data analysis, remote sensing, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and deep learning could create new applications to understand climatic changes better which would be helpful to increase agricultural productivity and food security. IoT gives a new dimension for smart farming and the agricultural domain. Thus, IoT based smart farming provides solutions to automate the process for irrigation systems, crop monitoring to improve the quality and quantity of crops and monitor the agriculture land with the help of IoT sensors. In this chapter, IoT based machine learning approach is proposed for rice plant disease detection and has achieved an accuracy of about 95% respectively. © 2022 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Because of insufficient laboratory facilities and a dependance on the knowledge of specialists, initial plant disease identification is a time-consuming process. If the diseases are not discovered in their early stages, then it is possible that they will have a negative impact on the overall yield, which will lead to a reduction in the profits made by the farmers. Several studies have discussed various state-of-the-art systems that are based on Deep Learning as well as Machine Learning methodologies in an effort to find a solution to this issue. On the other hand, the majority of such systems either employ large numbers of input variables or even have poor accuracy in their classifications. In this paper, an innovative combined approach for automatic detection of plant diseases is proposed. The model is based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Techniques for the automated detection of plant diseases offer a number of benefits, including the simplification of the lengthy process of observing large agricultural farms and the identification of disease symptoms at an early stage. In this work, the proposed combined approach is utilized to detect the disease known as Bacterial Spot that is present in plants by utilizing the leaf images of those plants. The proposed method achieves an accuracy rate of 98.85 percent when used for testing and 99.17 percent when used for training.  © 2022 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Intelligent models; Plant disease; Variational Autoencoder","Agriculture; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Variational techniques; % reductions; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease detection; Intelligent models; Laboratory facilities; Learning approach; Plant disease; Variational autoencoder; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","A.

However, the crop is vulnerable to many diseases. Research has revealed that image recognition using machine learning and deep learning techniques can be applied in automatic identification of cassava leaf diseases. Therefore this study focuses on using strongly discriminative features of the leaf regions affected by disease and weakening regions of low interest to improve the classification accuracy. A convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is a common attention mechanism integrated in feed-forward convolutional neural networks. In this study, CBAM is added to the pretrained ResNet50 and VGG19 models to recognize the cassava leaf regions affected by disease. This is done by sequentially inferring attention maps along two dimensions, channel and spatial for every intermediate feature map. The attention maps are then multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement. The performance of baseline models such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, Inceptionv3, and Xception is compared with the attention-based models trained, validated and tested on a public dataset from Makerere University AI laboratory. ResNet50+CBAM achieve the highest performance with accuracy of 97%, precision of 96%, recall of 94% and F-measure of 95%. Conclusively, attention-based models perform better than the baseline models with a performance improvement of over 1%. © 2023 IEEE.","attention mechanism; cassava leaf disease; classification; feature fusion; transfer learning","Automation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Feedforward neural networks; Image recognition; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Transfer learning; Attention mechanisms; Baseline models; Cassavum leaf disease; Disease classification; Feature map; Features fusions; Food crops; Leaf disease; Performance; Transfer learning; Deep learning","","","","","","","Mathulaprangsan S., Lanthong K., Cassava leaf disease recognition using convolutional neural networks, Proc. of 9th Int.

Leaf disease identification methods based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved good results, but the cost of labeling disease images is very high. Image augment and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) reduced the demand for labeled data. Other than these methods, this paper designs a novel CNN performed very well, which can greatly reduce the demand for training images. Firstly, the idea of decreasing CNN is proposed to learn much more visual features of plant leaves with fewer parameters. According to it, a kind of lightly decreasing CNN (D-CNN) is proposed in this paper, while the traditional mainstream CNNs are no decreasing. Further, for learning more lesion features, a two branch Species-Disease hybrid Convolution neural Network (SDCN) is designed to learn plant species and lesions features respectively, each branch of which is decreasing CNN. Experiments on the popular dataset PlantVillage show that the classification accuracy of SDCN achieves 99.81 % trained from scratch, while its parameters are only 13 % of VGG11. And SDCN achieves 98.26% classification accuracy trained on 25% of the training data, which is equivalent to the performance of mainstream CNNs trained on 100% of the training data. Even when trained on 6.25% of training data (50 images/class), its classification accuracy still reaches 92.58%, while others do not exceed 80%. It shows that SDCN has much stronger feature learning ability, which can greatly reduce the demand for training data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Decreasing CNN; Deep learning; Plant leaf disease recognition","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Plants (botany); Classification accuracy; Convolution neural network; Decreasing convolution neural network; Deep learning; Leaf disease; Plant leaf disease recognition; Plant leaves; Training data; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Li Zheng, Et al., Non-invasive plant disease diagnostics enabled by smartphone-based fingerprinting of leaf volatiles, Nature Plants, 5, 8, pp. 856-866, (2019); Kamilaris A., Prenafeta-Boldu F., A review of the use of convolutional neural networks in agriculture, J.

These plants, along with their leaves, have medicinal values. If these leaves are identified appropriately, they can be chosen directly to have more significant relief from the disease. Therefore, the identification of these medical species is a challenging task. The ecologically motivated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have substantially contributed to computer visual research. This article introduces a unique approach to medical leaf identification based on the hybridization of the Gaussian mixture model and a Convolutional Neural Network (GMM-CNN). The experimentation is performed on the Flavia dataset and is carried out using benchmark evaluation metrics. The parameters like index volume, probability of random index, and global consistency error are evaluated. The Python simulation model is utilized for the evaluation of the proposed methodology. The hybrid technique combining GMM and CNN has considerable potential in medical leaf identification. The experimental findings indicate that the hybrid strategy exhibits superior performances. The methodology suggested in this study demonstrates exceptional levels of accuracy, precision, and recall when applied to a wide range of medical leaf categories. Moreover, integrating Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) addresses concerns associated with a scarcity of training data by offering a more resilient structure for extracting features and performing classification. By combining the advantages of statistical modelling with deep learning, we develop a resilient and precise system that has the potential to enhance botanical research, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring applications. © 2020 Food and Fermentation Industries.

Any changes that occur in crop quality or crop productivity may greatly reduce the national economy. Thus, the detection of plant diseases should be done at the early stage before intensively affecting crop production. A new technique named smart farming is introduced to benefit in 'high-ended application of modern farming' by obtaining multiple data through live streams, social media, sensors, robots, etc. The attained data from diverse sources are required to processunder amultilevel database, which becomes more challenging while detecting plant diseases in smart farming techniques. The demands for using the machine learning approaches with unsupervised or supervised methods are increased on utilizing it in real-world applications. The main intention of this paper is to focus on the development of a novel crop disease detection model using the modified deep learning architecture. The images from different datasets with several crop diseases are collected from the public benchmark sources, and it is initially subjected to pre-processing using filtering and contrast enhancement techniques. Once the image is enhanced, the novel Optimized K-means Clustering (O-KMC) is adopted for performing the abnormality segmentation. Then, the feature extraction of the abnormality segmented images is done by the edge features and texture features. These features are utilized for disease recognition, in which the Heuristic-based Convolutional Neural Network with Recurrent Neural Network (H-C-RNN) is developed. In both segmentation and classification, the parameter improvement is performed by the Adaptive Inertia Weighted-Dragonfly Algorithm (AIW-DA). The performance of the proposed model under the different datasets is evaluated with various conventional methods that ensure the accurate identification of crop diseases in the proposed model.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

The correct and timely identification of several tomato plant leaf diseases is a complicated task as the healthy and affected areas of plant leaves are highly similar. Moreover, the incidence of light variation, color, and brightness changes, and the occurrence of blurring and noise on the images further increase the complexity of the detection process. In this article, we have presented a robust approach for tackling the existing issues of tomato plant leaf disease detection and classification by using deep learning. We have proposed a novel approach, namely the DenseNet-77-based CornerNet model, for the localization and classification of the tomato plant leaf abnormalities. Specifically, we have used the DenseNet-77 as the backbone network of the CornerNet. This assists in the computing of the more nominative set of image features from the suspected samples that are later categorized into 10 classes by the one-stage detector of the CornerNet model. We have evaluated the proposed solution on a standard dataset, named PlantVillage, which is challenging in nature as it contains samples with immense brightness alterations, color variations, and leaf images with different dimensions and shapes. We have attained an average accuracy of 99.98% over the employed dataset. We have conducted several experiments to assure the effectiveness of our approach for the timely recognition of the tomato plant leaf diseases that can assist the agriculturalist to replace the manual systems.

However, coffee plants are susceptible to various diseases that can lower production and quality. Early detection and identification of these diseases are critical in overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach for the identification and classification of coffee diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our research is divided into three phases: image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Gaussian filtering and data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the robustness of the model and reduce noise. We used a CNN to extract high-level features by combining GoogLeNet-based and RESNET-based architecture, which can capture more complex and meaningful characteristics of the input images, such as shapes, objects, and patterns, and are important for tasks such as object recognition and classification. The extracted features were then classified using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), machine learning, and ensemble classifiers. Our proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 99.08%, outperforming other classifiers. The results indicate that proper image preprocessing, data augmentation, and CNN provide an efficient classification method for identifying and classifying coffee diseases. © 2023 The Authors","Coffee disease; Convolutional Neural Network; Feature concatenation; Machine learning; Segmentation","Article; classifier; Coffea; convolutional neural network; deep learning; disease classification; environmental factor; feature extraction; image processing; k fold cross validation; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; noise reduction; nonhuman; plant disease; random forest; residual neural network; support vector machine","","","","","","","Dubey S.R., Jalal A.S., Apple disease classification using color, texture and shape features from images, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 10, pp. 819-826, (2016); Lamba S., Saini P., Kaur J., Kukreja V., Optimized classification model for plant diseases using generative adversarial networks, Innovat Syst Software Eng, pp. 1-13, (2022); Agarwal M., Singh A., Arjaria S., Sinha A., Gupta S., Toled: tomato leaf disease detection using convolution neural network, Proc Comput Sci, 167, pp. 293-301, (2020); Iqbal Z., Khan M.A., Sharif M., Shah J.H., ur Rehman M.H., Javed K., An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: a review, Comput Electron Agric, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Tiwari V., Joshi R.C., Dutta M.K., Dense convolutional neural networks based multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images, Ecol Inf, 63, (2021); Belachew K., Teferi D., Hundessa N., Tesfaye S., The statue and management of coffee wilt disease (gibberella xylarioides) in ethiopian coffee production, J Nat Sci Res, 6, pp. 16-21, (2016); Kotsiantis S.B., Zaharakis I., Pintelas P., Et al., Supervised machine learning: a review of classification techniques, Emerging artificial intelligence applications in computer engineering, 160, pp. 3-24, (2007); Hindorf H., Omondi C.O., A review of three major fungal diseases of coffea arabica l. in the rainforests of Ethiopia and progress in breeding for resistance in Kenya, J Adv Res, 2, pp. 109-120, (2011); Yebasse M., Shimelis B., Warku H., Ko J., Cheoi K.J., Coffee disease visualization and classification, Plants, 10, (2021); Ahila Priyadharshini R., Arivazhagan S., Arun M., Mirnalini A., Maize leaf disease classification using deep convolutional neural networks, Neural Comput Appl, 31, pp. 8887-8895, (2019); Mengistu A.D., Alemayehu D.M., Mengistu S.G., Ethiopian coffee plant diseases recognition based on imaging and machine learning techniques, International Journal of Database Theory and Application, 9, pp. 79-88, (2016); Al-gaashani M.S., Shang F., Muthanna M.S., Khayyat M., Abd El-Latif A.A., Tomato leaf disease classification by exploiting transfer learning and feature concatenation, IET Image Process, 16, pp. 913-925, (2022); DerwinSuhartono W.A., Lestari M., Yasin M., Expert system in detecting coffee plant diseases, Int.

Cassava is loaded with carbohydrates and is mostly cultivated by small farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa as a security crop as it is capable of growing amidst drought which affects mostly all the other crops directly and adversely. At present, farmers are completely dependent on plant health experts to come and have a weekly or bi-weekly random inspection of the plants. They collect leaf samples from 3 different parts of the plant - top, middle, and lower parts and send them to the lab for testing. This takes up a lot of time and does not leave enough time for farmers to find a solution once the plants get affected. Therefore, it is important for farmers to detect the diseases as early as possible. To tackle this problem, we propose a disease detection model for cassava plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The features in the cassava plant images which signify the presence of disease will be automatically learned by the Neural Network. The farmers cannot detect these features manually. This research was conducted using a dataset of 21,397 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda comprising four diseases namely Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Green Mottle (CGM), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and the dataset also contains healthy images of the plant. Most of the images in this dataset were taken by farmers in their gardens to provide a realistic representation of how farmers would diagnose these diseases in real life. These images were annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala.  © 2022 IEEE.","Automation; Cassava disease recognition; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Deep Learning; DenseNet; Disease Identification; Farmers; Image classification; Survey; Transfer Learning","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Plants (botany); Surveys; Transfer learning; Cassavum disease recognition; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Densenet; Disease identification; Farmer; Images classification; Sub-saharan africa; Transfer learning; Image classification","","","","","","","Nassar N., Ortiz R., Breeding cassava to feed the poor, Scientific American, 302, 5, pp. 78-85, (2010); Amelework A.B., Bairu M.W., Maema O., Venter S.L., Laing M., Adoption and promotion of resilient crops for climate risk mitigation and import substitution: A case analysis of cassava for south african agriculture, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 5, (2021); Madamombe I., Is cassava Africa's new staple food?, Africa Renewal, 20, 2, (2006); Alabi O.J., Kumar P.L., Naidu R.A., Cassava mosaic disease: A curse to food security in subSaharan Africa, APSnet Features, (2011); Legg J.P., Thresh J.M., Cassava mosaic virus disease in East Africa: A dynamic disease in a changing environment, Virus research, 71, 1-2, pp. 135-149, (2000); Maruthi M.N., Et al., A method for generating virus-free cassava plants to combat viral disease, Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology, 105, pp. 77-87, (2019); Ramcharan A., Baranowski K., McCloskey P., Ahmed B., Legg J., Hughes D.P., Deep learning for image-based cassava disease detection, Frontiers in plant science, 8, (2017); Sladojevic S., Arsenovic M., Anderla A., Culibrk D., Stefanovic D., Deep neural networks based recognition of plant diseases by leaf image classification, Computational intelligence and neuroscience, pp. 1-11, (2016); Sambasivam G., Opiyo G.D., A predictive machine learning application in agriculture: Cassava disease detection and classification with imbalanced dataset using convolutional neural networks, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22, 1, pp. 27-34, (2021); Abayomi-Alli O.O., Damasevicius R., Misra S., Maskeliunas R., Cassava disease recognition from low-quality images using enhanced data augmentation model and deep learning, Expert Systems, 38, 7, (2021)","A.A.

The VGG is used to replace the U-Net backbone to enhance the segmentation performance of the network. Results: Compared to existing networks, the proposed method achieved recognition accuracy of over 95%. In addition, the accuracies of the segmentation models were compared. VGG-U-Net, a network generated by replacing the backbone of U-Net with VGG, is found to have the best segmentation performance with an accuracy of 87.66%. This method is most suitable for diagnosing the severity level of citrus fruit diseases. In the meantime, transfer learning is applied to improve the training cycle of the network model, both in the detection and severity diagnosis phases of the disease. Discussion: The results of the comparison experiments reveal that the proposed method is effective in identifying and diagnosing the severity of citrus fruit diseases identification.

India, being one of the world’s most important rice producers and consumers, relies heavily on rice to propel its economy and provide its food needs. In the crop protective device, early and precise diagnosis of plant diseases is critical. Traditionally, identification was done either through visual inspection or laboratory testing. It is critical to identify any disease early and perform the necessary treatment to the damaged plants in order to guarantee the rice plants’ healthy and proper growth. Because disease detection by hand takes a long time and requires a lot of effort, having an automated system is unavoidable. A rice plant disease identification method depends on deep learning methodologies are presented in this research. Leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight, sheat blight, and brown spot diseases are four of the most frequent rice plant diseases identified in this study. The rice plant disease is identified and recognized using deep learning algorithms. This method of early detection of rice diseases could be utilized as a preventative tool as well as an early detection. The proposed approach provides enhanced accuracy of 99.45% and it is compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022 River Publishers.","Classification; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Pattern recognition; Rice plant disease","","","","","","","","Ferentinos Konstantinos P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018); Ramcharan Amanda, Baranowski Kelsee, McCloskey Peter, Ahmed Babuali, Legg James, Hughes David P., Deep learning for image-based cassava disease detection, Frontiers in plant science, 8, (2017); Ashqar Belal AM, Abu-Naser Samy S., Image-based tomato leaves diseases detection using deep learning, (2018); Arsenovic Marko, Karanovic Mirjana, Sladojevic Srdjan, Anderla Andras, Stefanovic Darko, Solving current limitations of deep learning based approaches for plant disease detection, Symmetry, 11, 7, (2019); Amara Jihen, Bouaziz Bassem, Algergawy Alsayed, A deep learning-based approach for banana leaf diseases classification, Datenbanksysteme für Business, Technologie und Web (BTW 2017)-Workshopband, (2017); Jiang Peng, Chen Yuehan, Liu Bin, He Dongjian, Liang Chunquan, Real-time detection of apple leaf diseases using deep learning approach based on improved convolutional neural networks, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 59069-59080, (2019); Mohanty S.P., Hughes D.P., Salathe M., Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Front.

Given the rapidity development is occurring. The recognition of diseased plants is made computerised and data-driven as a result of smart farming, enabling enhanced assistance with decisions, clever analysis, and management. Plant Disease has developed widely, necessitating precise investigation and quick deep learning applications in the classification of plant diseases. When a plant is sick, it may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms, such as coloured streaks or spots on the leaves. The colour, structure, and proportions of the visual symptoms alter as the disease worsens. Deep CNN can be used to train these patterns and produce a model that can identify them. The framework was designed and developed using the MobileNet V2 architecture. A 94% accuracy rate was reached after training on a chosen dataset. Using the chosen topology for 30 epochs results in the development of a convolutional neural network. For this undertaking, a user interface may also be designed. Farmers can use any smartphone with an adequate camera to take pictures of plant leaves by utilising the application. Multiple disorders can be identified using the smartphone application, making it simpler for users. Along with the diagnosis of plant diseases, pesticide recommendations and precautions for the recognised diseases are also recommended. This research offers a deep learning method for automating the detection of plant diseases. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used in the created system.  © 2023 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; Detection; Machine learning; Plant Disease","Convolution; Crops; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; mHealth; Plants (botany); Smartphones; User interfaces; Accuracy rate; Classification and identifications; Convolutional neural network; Data driven; Detection; Disease classification; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Smart phones; Visual symptoms; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Saleem M.H., Potgieter J., Arif K.M., A Performance-Optimized Deep Learning-Based Plant Disease Detection Approach for Horticultural Crops of New Zealand, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 89798-89822, (2022); Barburiceanu S., Meza S., Orza B., Malutan R., Terebes R., Convolutional Neural Networks for Texture Feature Extraction.

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models. © 2022 by the authors.","CNN; deep learning; leaf disease; leaf pathology; transfer learning","","","","","","","","Alston J.M., Pardey P.G., Agriculture in the Global Economy, J.

This study suggests a unique method that combines deep learning and machine learning algorithms for leaf classification. The proposed method involves a novel combination that employs Residual Network (ResNet50) for extraction of features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing the dimensions of feature vector and Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) to perform classification. The proposed method is evaluated on a 40-class dataset of leaves from the UCI repository and achieve an impressive accuracy of 95.70%. Furthermore, we compare the time complexity of this method with other boosting models such as XGBoost and CatBoost and investigated the role of component selection in the classification task. The proposed approach has the capability to address various classification problems within the domains of computer - vision and machine learning.

Following recent improvements in image processing, visual plant disease analysis is a current tool for dealing with this problem. The problem of plant disease detection, which is done visually for identification of plant disease, is examined in this paper. Compared to other forms of photographic photos, plant disease images are more likely to feature randomly spread lesions, variable symptoms, and complicated backdrops, making discriminative information difficult to capture. PlantVillage Dataset, which contains 20,000 photos divided into 15 classifications, is used to help with plant disease recognition study. The PlantVillage dataset was used to train the models. In this work, the performance of ResNet-50 deep learning architecture was compared against CNN, and deep learning models in the categorization of plant leaf diseases. The PlantVillage dataset was used to train models. This study assessed the performance of ResNet-50 deep learning architecture to CNN, and deep learning models in plant leaf disease classification.

Plant disease, along with natural calamities, is a major cause of economic losses due to their effects on agricultural productivity. The time and accuracy of conventional disease detection methods for tomatoes has long been unacceptable. Early disease monitoring, identification, and classification are crucial to addressing this issue, and deep learning has emerged as the preferred approach for automated object recognition and detection. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have found widespread application in object detection, including the identification of tomato leaf disease. The literature ranks ResNet-101, VGGNet, AlexNet, LeNet, and Google Net as the top five CNN models for tomato leaf disease detection, based on a dataset of 10 distinct disease classes.

A more accurate and timelier prognosis of agricultural leaf diseases could aid in the creation of an immediate corrective method, greatly reducing economic and production losses. Deep learning technical developments have enabled investigators to significantly improve the performance and accuracy of object identification and recognition systems. The primary objective is to establish how to come up with a more applicable neural network framework for the stated duties. In the present article, we put forward the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for detecting crop leaf diseases in an assortment of plants employing images taken from plant leaves. As a result, it is able to appropriately assess the detection and classification processes. The proposed crop leaf disease forecasts include four stages: preprocessing to enhance and shrink images using the contrast stretching approach; segmentation using k-means clustering technique; feature extraction and classification using convolutional neural networks. Following that, we detected and displayed in the conversation box several segmentation features, classifier performance metrics, and statistical and structural features of the anticipated disease type. Finally, the acquired findings were compared to existing methodologies, and it was determined that the proposed plant disease prediction method is both accurate and efficient. © 2023 IEEE.","Classification; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Leaf Disease; Detection; Feature Extraction","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Extraction; Food processing; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Crop leaf disease; Crop leaves; Detection; Economic loss; Features extraction; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Learning techniques; Processing environments; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Image processing technique for automatic detection of plant diseases and alerting system in agricultural farms, Int.

Traditional methods of disease detection rely on the expertise of plant protection experts, which can be subjective and dependent on individual experience and knowledge. To address this, the use of digital image recognition technology and deep learning algorithms has emerged as a promising approach for automating plant disease identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in conjunction with Inception v3 to identify plant leaf diseases. The research focuses on developing a mobile application that leverages this mechanism to identify diseases in plants and provide recommendations for overcoming specific diseases. The models were trained using a dataset consisting of 80,848 images representing 21 different plant leaves categorized into 60 distinct classes. Through rigorous training and evaluation, the proposed system achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99%. This mobile application serves as a convenient and valuable advisory tool, providing early detection and guidance in real agricultural environments. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize plant disease detection and management practices. By automating the identification process through deep learning algorithms, the proposed system eliminates the subjective nature of expert-based diagnosis and reduces dependence on individual expertise. The integration of mobile technology further enhances accessibility and enables farmers and agricultural practitioners to swiftly and accurately identify diseases in their crops. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

One of the main challenges in agriculture is the prevention and early detection of pest attack on crops. Farmers spend a significant amount of time and money in detecting pests and diseases, often by looking at plant leaves and analyzing the presence of diseases and pests. Late detection of pest attacks and improper use of pesticide application can cause damage to plants and compromise food quality. This problem can be solved through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and accurate image classification systems. In recent years, machine learning has made improvements in image recognition and classification. Hence, in this research article, we used convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models, such as the Cov2D library and VGG-16, to identify pest attacks. Our experiments involved a personal dataset consisting of 7000 images of pest-attacked leaf samples of different positions on maize plants, categorized into two classes. The Google Colab environment was used for experimentation and implementation, specially designed for cloud computing and machine learning. © 2023 by the authors.","Cov2D; DCNN; deep learning; machine learning; VGG-16","","","","","","","","Seelam V., kumar Penugonda A., Kalyan B.P., Priya M.B., Prakash M.D., Smart Attendance Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision, Mater.

Thus, a rapid and accurate recognition of various diseases in plant will not only significantly reduce unnecessary planting costs, but also alleviate the economic losses and environmental pollution caused by incorrect disease diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have improved the performance in recognizing plant leaf diseases. In this paper, we present a general framework for recognizing plant diseases. Firstly, we propose a deep feature descriptor based on transfer learning to obtain a high-level latent feature representation. Then, we integrate the deep features with traditional handcrafted features by feature fusion to capture the local texture information in plant leaf images. In addition, centre loss is incorporated to further enhance the discriminative ability of the fused feature. The centre loss simultaneously minimizes intra-class distance and maximizes inter-class distance to learn both compact and separate features. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three publicly available datasets (two Apple Leaf datasets and one Coffee Leaf dataset) to validate the effectiveness of proposed method. The propose method achieves 99.79%, 92.59% and 97.12% classification accuracies on the three datasets, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the discriminative feature representation for distinguishing plant leaf diseases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Feature fusion; Plant disease; Transfer learning","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Cultivation; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image fusion; Plants (botany); Textures; Convolutional neural network; Feature representation; Features fusions; Image-based; Leaf disease; Leaf images; Leaves of plants; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Transfer learning; agricultural production; artificial neural network; classification; cultivation; deciduous tree; disease; experimental study; food security; identification method; model validation; recognition; Losses","","","","","","","Badrinarayanan V., Kendall A., Cipolla R., Segnet: A deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation, IEEE Trans.

The proposed method involves constructing a residual network model using a characteristic surface obtained via natural neighborhood interpolation based on preprocessed near-infrared spectral reflection signal and first-order differential spectral index. The input layer is a pseudo spectral map that is generated through surface projection of the characteristic surface. The generated spectral pseudo image contains a diverse set of spectral features that augment the representation capability of the pseudo-image while retaining the spectral band reflectance information.

Plant diseases affect the quality and yields of agriculture. Early-stage identification of crop disease decreases financial losses and positively impacts crop quality. The manual identification of crop diseases, which are mostly visible on leaves, is a very time-consuming and costly process. In this work, we propose a new framework for the recognition of cucumber leaf diseases. The proposed framework is based on deep learning and involves the fusion and selection of the best features. In the feature extraction phase, VGG (Visual Geometry Group) and Inception V3 deep learning models are considered and fine-tuned. Both fine-tuned models are trained using deep transfer learning. Features are extracted in the later step and fused using a parallel maximum fusion approach. In the later step, best features are selected using Whale Optimization algorithm. The best-selected features are classified using supervised learning algorithms for the final classification process. The experimental process was conducted on a privately collected dataset that consists of five types of cucumber disease and achieved accuracy of 96.5%. A comparison with recent techniques shows the significance of the proposed method. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Corn, potatoes and tomatoes are the most cultivated grains in southern China. The leaves of the three crops are very fragile and sensitive and are susceptible to leaf diseases, such as leaf blight of corn, late blight of potato and mosaic virus of tomato. These diseases cannot be identified at early stages. Therefore, an efficient solution is proposed by deep learning techniques to detect the disease categories of crops, which can effectively prevent the spread of diseases and ensure the normal growth of plants. In this experiment, our model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.55% for the identification of the three diseases of corn, potato and tomato. In addition, we tested the three plants individually. The classification accuracy of our model on corn, potato and tomato was 98.44%, 99.43% and 95.20%, respectively. We have also developed a web-based real-time plant disease classification system and deployed our model. The system had good performance in time and accuracy evaluation metrics. The results of this study showed that our model had fewer parameters, shorter training time, and higher recognition accuracy compared to existing image classification models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional block attention module; Deep learning; Plant disease classification; Web application","China; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Fruits; Plants (botany); Viruses; Classification models; Convolutional block attention module; Deep learning; Disease classification; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Plant disease classification; Residual structure; WEB application; Web applications; algorithm; ecological modeling; growth; image classification; leaf area; potato; Convolution","","","","","Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2019C54005); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61403346, 61605173); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY16C130003); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0126100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFE0126100); the Key Research and Development Program in Zhejiang Province of China (2019C54005); National Natural Science Foundation of China (61605173) and (61403346); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY16C130003).

The research focuses on the development of an automatic system capable of performing the segmentation of leaf lesions and the detection of disease without requiring human intervention. To get lesion region segmentation, we propose a context-aware 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on CANet architecture that considers the ambiguity of plant lesion placement in the plant leaf image subregions. A Deep CNN is employed to recognize the subtype of leaf lesion using the segmented lesion area. Finally, the plant’s survival is predicted using a hybrid method combining CNN and Linear Regression. To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed plant disease detection scheme and survival prediction, we utilized the Plant Village Benchmark Dataset, which is composed of several photos of plant leaves affected by a certain disease. Using the DICE and IoU matrices, the segmentation model performance for plant leaf lesion segmentation is evaluated. The proposed lesion segmentation model achieved an average accuracy of 92% with an IoU of 90%. In comparison, the lesion subtype recognition model achieves accuracies of 91.11%, 93.01 and 99.04 for pepper, potato and tomato plants. The higher accuracy of the proposed model indicates that it can be utilized for real-time disease detection in unmanned aerial vehicles and offline to offer crop health updates and reduce the risk of low yield.

The traditional approach of detecting leaf diseases in fruit plants requires farmers to undertake manual inspection which exhibits a lack of reliability and consistency. Moreover, the manual inspection procedure is prone to errors due to its reliance on the farmer's knowledge and skill. Mango referred to as the ""king of all fruits"", is renowned for its rich composition of various vitamins and vital nutrients. Mangoes are susceptible to many diseases that adversely damage their visual appeal, and flavor, and have significant implications on the overall economy. The identification of diseases affecting mango plant leaves using automated recognition remains a challenge due to the diverse range of symptoms and limited availability of data. There have been several deep learning-based research studies focused on identifying diseases in mango leaves; however, the majority of these studies have employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a small number of data. This study presents a Vision Transformer (ViT) based approach to detect diseases in mango leaves using publicly available data namely MangoLeafBD. The ViT model has been selected as the detection model due to its parameter efficiency compared to deep CNN models. The ViT has produced remarkable overall classification accuracy of 100%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and f1-score of 100% for disease detection on mango leaves which is better than the existing CNN approaches on the MangoLeafBD dataset. This demonstrates that our approach has the potential to assist farmers in the field by providing automated, simple, and more reliable mango leaf disease diagnosis.  © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; Image classification; Mango leaf disease; Vision Transformer (ViT)","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fresh food; Fruit crops; Images classification; Leaf disease; Mango leaf disease; Manual inspection; Plant disease; Vision transformer; Fruits","","","","","","","Mitra S., Mango production in the world-present situation and future prospect, XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): IV 1111, pp. 287-296, (2014); Mia M.R., Roy S., Das S.K., Rahman M.A., Mango leaf disease recognition using neural network and support vector machine, Iran Journal of Computer Science, 3, pp. 185-193, (2020); Strange R.N., Scott P.R., Plant disease: A threat to global food security, Annu.

Scientists are striving to develop a mechanism for identifying plant ailments in order to boost farm output. Deep learning algorithms have been developed for pathogen recognition and prediction in tomato plant leaves. Two different types of diseases impact both healthy and sick leaves. A Convolution Neural Network, which is effective for detection and prediction barrier, was used to forecast Septoria spot and bacterial spot. A dataset of 4930 images of healthy and damaged leaves from a plant community is used for the experiments. The model's performance is precisely evaluated, and the conclusion is accurate. The project makes use of Plant Village images of tomato, potato, and onion leaves. Four different classes can each be recognized by the suggested CNNs. In each instance, the trained model achieves accuracy of 100%, 98.3%, and 97.89%. The classification of leaf disease detection using simulation data shows the potential effectiveness of the proposed approach. The algorithm proposed can be applied to categories any additional species of native plant to Tamil Nadu. Self Help Groups (SHGs), which are found in each and every village in India, will be utilized to gather information on how farmers see themselves. The observations and ameliorate both will be communicated to the same SHGs. Because of its high success rate, the model is a good tool for counselling or early warning. © 2023 IEEE.","Convolution Neural Network; Image processing; plant diseases; plant leaves; self Help Group","Convolution; Deep learning; Fruits; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Plants (botany); Rural areas; Convolution neural network; Images processing; Leaf disease; Learning frameworks; Native plants; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Plant pathogen; Self help group; Tamil Nadu; Forecasting","","","","","","","Suttapakti U., Bunpeng A., Potato Leaf Disease Classification Based on Distinct Color and Texture Feature Extraction, 2019 19th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT), pp. 82-85, (2019); Wang X., Xu B., Liu X., Ichinose H., Analysis of ultrastructures in Fe-encapsulating onion-like fullerenes, Microscopy, 55, 1, pp. 13-16, (2006); Chen J., Chen J., Zhang D., Sun Y., Nanehkaran Y.A., Using deep transfer learning for image-based plant disease identification, Computer, Electronics, and Agriculture, 173, (2020); Mads D., Karstoft H., Midtiby H.S., Plant species classification using deep convolutional neural network, Biosystems engineering, 151, pp. 72-80, (2016); Ma J., Du K., Zheng F., Zhang L., Gong Z., Sun Z., A recognition method for cucumber diseases using leaf symptom images based on deep convolutional neural network, IEEE Acess, 154, pp. 18-24, (2018); Ma L., Guo X., Doud S.Z., Algorithm of Strawberry Disease Recognition Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, (2020); Ramani G.G., Pandian J.A., Identification of plant leaf diseases using a nine-layer deep convolutional neural network, IEEE Acess, 76, pp. 323-338, (2019); Ozblge E., Ulukok M.K., Toygar O., Ozblge E., Tomato Disease Recognition Using a Compact Convolutional Neural Network, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 77213-77224, (2022); Zhang Z., Zhao M., Chow T.W.S., Binary-and Multi-class Group Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Feature Extraction and Classification, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25, 10, pp. 2192-2205, (2013); Mendenhall M.J., Merenyi E., Relevance-Based Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Images, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 19, 4, pp. 658-672, (2008); Minaee S., Boykov Y., Porikli F., Plaza A., Kehtarnavaz N., Terzopoulos D., Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 44, 7, pp. 3523-3542, (2022); Anaya-Isaza A., Mera-Jimenez L., Cabrera-Chavarro J.M., Guachi-Guachi L., Peluffo-Ordonez D., Rios-Patino J.I., Comparison of Current Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for the Segmentation of Breast Masses in Mammograms, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 152206-152225, (2021); Ren S., He K., Girshick R., Sun J., Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 6, pp. 1137-1149, (2017); Mohanty S.P., Hughes D.P., Salathe M., Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in plant science, 7, (2016); Chouhan S.S., Kaul A., Singh U.P., Jain S., Bacterial Foraging Optimization Based Radial Basis Function Neural Network (BRBFNN) for Identification and Classification of Plant Leaf Diseases: An Automatic Approach Towards Plant Pathology, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 8852-8863, (2018); Islam M., Dinh A., Wahid K., Bhowmik P., Detection of potato diseases using image segmentation and multiclass support vector machine, 2017 IEEE 30th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE), pp. 1-4, (2017); Suo-Meng D., Zhou S., Potato late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans: From molecular interactions to integrated management strategies, Journal of Integrative Agriculture, pp. 3456-3466, (2022); Kumar M., Kumar A., Palaparthy V.S., Soil Sensors-Based Prediction System for Plant Diseases Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, IEEE Sensors Journal, 21, 16, pp. 17455-17468, (2021); Kavitha K., Arivazhagan S., Kayalvizhi N., Wavelet based spatial-Spectral hyperspectral image classification technique using Support Vector Machines, Second International conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies, pp. 1-6, (2010); Kavitha K., Arivazhagan S., Fuzzy inspired image classification algorithm for hyperspectral data using three-dimensional log-Gabor features, Optik, 125, 20, pp. 6236-6241, (2014); Poornam S., Saviour F., Devaraj A., Image based Plant leaf disease detection using Deep learning, Inernational journal of computer communication and informatics, 3, pp. 53-65, (2021)","K.

Although there are many deep learning-based plant disease detection models, the existing deep learning networks have complex structures and require large amounts of computational resources for support. Lightweight networks such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet designed for mobile devices could achieve better classification and faster recognition on public datasets, but their accuracy rates are not yet up to the requirements of practical applications. To address these problems, we constructed an improved apple leaf disease recognition algorithm based on MobileNetV2. We used feature reuse to improve the network structure, added a dense connection structure to the inverse residual module, and an ECA-Net attention module to increase the model’s focus on diseased regions. We trained the improved model on the network on a dataset expanded by a generative adversarial network. The results showed that the improved model had a smaller number of model parameters, only 3.3 M, and a higher accuracy rate of 96.23% compared to Resnet50, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet models. The improved model had only 0.34 M addition in the number of parameters compared with MobileNet-V2, and had a 2.2% improvement in accuracy. © 2023, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

The majority among these image processing techniques algorithms used “shallow” machine learning architectures until recently and some still do a unique classification model that combines a deep Siamese network with a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. The DL network is quickly becoming the gold standard in pattern recognition and analysis of images research. Whatever the case may be, there is not a lot of evidence that it can used to identify disease in plant leaves. As a result, both models were used to generate a large plant leaf disease image in this investigation. Early identification of the type of plant disease present is required to give effective procedures for detection and avoidance of destruction. In recent years, a lot of effort has gone into identifying plant diseases that are found in various places of the world and harm various crops. There is a significant amount of effort being carried out in the field of identifying disease-causing variables. Viruses cause some of the diseases, while others are caused by fungal infections.

However, the current field of intelligent plant diseases identification still faces the problems of insufficient data and inaccurate classification. Aiming to resolve these problems, the present research proposes an image information contribution evaluation method based on the analysis of inter-class similarity. Combining this method with the active learning image selection strategy can provide guidance for the collection and annotation of intelligent identification datasets of plant diseases, so as to improve the recognition effect and reduce the cost. The method proposed includes two modules: the inter-classes similarity evaluation module and the image information contribution evaluation module. The images located on the decision boundary between high similarity classes will be analysis as high information contribution images, they will provide more information for plant diseases classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, experiments were carried on the fine-grained classification dataset of tomato diseases. Experimental results confirm the superiority of this method compared with others. This research is in the field of plant disease classification. For the detection and segmentation, further research is advisable. © 2022 by the authors.","few-shot learning; fine-grained classification; inter-class similarity; plant disease identification; smart agriculture","algorithm; data set; decision making; detection method; fruit; image analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32101612)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 32101612).","Sliwinski D., Konieczna A., Roman K., Geostatistical resampling of lidar-derived dem in wide resolution range for modelling in swat: A case study of zgłowiączka river (poland), Remote Sens, 14, (2022); Nuthalapati S.V., Tunga A., Multi-domain few-shot learning and dataset for agricultural applications, Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1399-1408; Yang J., Ni J., Li Y., Wen J., Chen D., The intelligent path planning system of agricultural robot via reinforcement learning, Sensors, 22, (2022); Mahlein A.K., Heim R.H., Brugger A., Gold K., Li Y., Bashir A.K., Paulus S., Kuska M.T., Digital plant pathology for precision agriculture, J.

Plant infections can cause significant harvest losses and the extinction of species. The swift identification of plant illnesses by means of precise or automated detection techniques can improve the quality of food production and reduce economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has significantly enhanced the accuracy of image classification and object detection systems' recognition capabilities. This study discovers four distinct leaf types on the leaves of corn and classifies them according to the plant diseases that cause them. These leaf varieties are referred to as blight, common rust, grey leaf spot and healthy leaves. The number of samples collected for each is 1306, 574, 1146, and 1164, respectively. By extracting deep features, three distinct enhanced deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to classify corn leaf disease. The validation accuracy, test accuracy, prediction, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) are analysed to determine performance.

Various learning approaches for plant disease detection and classification have been adopted to detect and diagnose these diseases early. However, deep learning entails extensive data for training, and it may be challenging to collect plant datasets. Even though plant datasets can be collected, they may be uneven in quantity. As a result, the problem of classification model overfitting arises. This study targets this issue and proposes an auxiliary classifier GAN (small-ACGAN) model based on a small number of datasets to extend the available data. First, after comparing various attention mechanisms, this paper chose to add the lightweight Coordinate Attention (CA) to the generator module of Auxiliary Classifier GANs (ACGAN) to improve the image quality. Then, a gradient penalty mechanism was added to the loss function to improve the training stability of the model. Experiments show that the proposed method can best improve the recognition accuracy of the classifier with the doubled dataset. On AlexNet, the accuracy was increased by 11.2%. In addition, small-ACGAN outperformed the other three GANs used in the experiment. Moreover, the experimental accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of the five convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on the enhanced dataset improved by an average of 3.74%, 3.48%, 3.74%, and 3.80% compared to the original dataset. Furthermore, the accuracy of MobileNetV3 reached 97.9%, which fully demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The general experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper provides a new dataset expansion method for effectively improving the identification accuracy and can play an essential role in expanding the dataset of the sparse number of plant diseases. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Rice plants are susceptible to many diseases whose spread is induced by weather conditions such as high humidity and rainfall producing detrimental effects on crop's yield and thus affecting the country's food security. Rapid, early, and correct detection of rice plant disease is warranted to prevent spread and avoiding its detrimental effects through an early institution of preventive measures. The purpose of the study is to ascertain the distinguishing capability of convolutional neural networks in the recognition of rice plant disease. Deep learning models (base convolutional neural and pre-trained networks) were applied to the Philippine Rice Disease Dataset to diagnose rice plant diseases. VGG16 obtained the best performance with a 96% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 97% precision, 98% F1-score, and a 0.834 normalized Matthews Correlation Coefficient. InceptionV3 also generated superior performance while the base model had a lower diagnostic capability. These models can be useful complementary tools which may be deployed as quick and non-invasive diagnostic support instruments assisting farmers in the evaluation of rice diseases especially in communities where agricultural experts are limited. Farmers would gain more valid outcomes with these technological approaches, enabling them to institute cost-effective measures. Thus, effective management of rice plant diseases, optimized and efficient use of available resources leading to improved rice crop productivity can be achieved. A working partnership of agriculturists and machine learning enthusiasts is crucial to achieve the desired goal of early identification of rice plant diseases for prompt intervention efforts to be instituted.  © 2023 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; deep learning; rice plant disease","Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Food supply; Learning systems; Noninvasive medical procedures; Asian countries; Condition; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Performance; Philippines; Plant disease; Rice plant disease; Rice plants; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Mamiit R.J., Yanagida J., Miura T., Productivity Hot Spots and Cold Spots: Setting Geographic Priorities for Achieving Food Production Targets, Front.

It is important to recognize the image captured for monitoring the growth of plants and preventing diseases and pests. Currently, the task of automatic recognition of crop diseases is to research crop diseases based on deep learning, but the existing classifiers have problems regarding, for example, accurate identification of similar disease categories. Tomato is selected as the crop of this article, and the corresponding tomato disease is the main research point. The vision transformer (VIT) method has achieved good results on image tasks. Aiming at image recognition, tomato plant images serve as this article’s data source, and their structure is improved based on global ViT and local CNN (convolutional neural network) networks, which are built to diagnose disease images. Therefore, the features of plant images can be precisely and efficiently extracted, which is more convenient than traditional artificial recognition. The proposed architecture’s efficiency was evaluated by three image sets from three tomato-growing areas and acquired by drone and camera. The results show that this article method garners an average counting accuracy of 96.30%. It provides scientific support and a reference for the decision-making process of precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease diagnosing; precision agriculture; regional agriculture; visual transformer","","","","","","national key science and technology infrastructure project, (4444-10099609)","This project is supported by the national key science and technology infrastructure project “National Research Facility for Phenotypic and Genotypic Analysis of Model Animals”, grant number “4444-10099609”.","Ramankutty N., Mehrabi Z., Waha K., Kremen C., Herrero M., Rieseberg L.H., Trends in global agricultural land use: Implications for environmental health and food security, Annu.

In plants with various climatic circumstances, illness is highly prevalent and natural. As a result, the quality of crop deteriorates. Getting the best quality and quantity of harvest is farmers' most challenging task due to recent changes in weather cycles. Crop diseases must be identified and prevented as soon as possible to improve productivity. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence branch. It has been actively discussed in academic and industrial circles in recent days, because of the advantages of autonomous learning and feature extraction. The use of learning-based algorithms in plant leaf disease recognition can help to strengthen the objectivity of plant leaf disease feature extraction, minimize the limitations of intentionally selecting disease spot features, and speed up the study. In this paper, we examine existing approaches to detecting plant leaf disease using deep learning and high-end imaging methods, as well as their challenges. We anticipate that our research will be useful to researchers interested in plant disease identification. The traditional CNN has the issue of using up too much computational power. To address this issue, this research developed a DCNN (Dilated Convolutional Neural Network) model with Global Average Pooling (GAP), which will be constructed by changing regular CNN convolution kernels with dilated convolution kernels and the fully connected layer in traditional CNN replaced by Global Average Pooling. The dilated convolution gives the advantages of less computational cost and reduced memory usage then GAP avoids overfitting. These two new concepts are implemented with CNN and the results of this method is compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods using performance metric such as precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy. The classification includes four classes such as bacterial blight, blast, brown spot and turgo. The performance metrics shows that, in the same experimental setup, the DCNN model with GAP improves training accuracy by 5.49 percent on average, compared to the classic CNN model and the results are compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; DCNN; Deep learning; GAP; Plant leaf disease","Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Productivity; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Dilated convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Global average pooling; Leaf disease; Neural network model; Plant disease; Plant leaf disease; Plant leaves; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; identification method; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Islam M., Dinh A., Wahid K., Bhowmik P., Detection of potato diseases using image segmentation and multiclass support vector machine, 2017 IEEE 30th canadian conference on electrical and computer engineering (CCECE), pp. 1-4, (2017); Sethy P.K., Barpanda N.K., Rath A.K., Behera S.K., Deep feature based rice leaf disease identification using support vector machine, Comput.

Deep learning is a promising tool in pattern recognition and machine learning and it can be used to identify and classify diseases in paddy rice. In this study, 2 different paddy rice diseases, including rice blast and brown spot, were investigated in the district of İpsala in the province of Edirne between the 2020 and 2021 production seasons by collecting 1569 images. These diseases are very common and important in Edirne province and surrounding rice production areas. Therefore, practical methods are needed to identify and classify these two diseases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was created by applying pre-processing techniques such as rescaling, rotation, and data augmentation to the paddy rice disease images. The classification model was created in Google Colab, which is a web-based Python editor using Tensorflow and Keras libraries. The CNN model was able to classify rice blast and brown spot diseases with high accuracy of 91.70%. © 2022, Centenary University.

As most are edible however, consumption of the wrong herbal plants can have serious consequences and even lead to death. Automatic accurate recognition of plant species to help users who do not have specialist knowledge of herbal plants is thus a desirable aim. Several automatic medicinal plant identification systems have been proposed, though most are significantly constrained either in the small number of species or in requiring manual image segmentation of plant leaves. This means they are captured on a plain background rather than being readily identified in their natural surroundings, which often involve complex and noisy backgrounds. While deep learning (DL) based methods have made considerable strides in recent times, their potential has not always been maximised because they are trained with samples which are not always fully representative of the intra-class and inter-class differences between the plant species concerned. This paper addresses this challenge by incorporating mutual information into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to select samples for the training, validation, and testing sets based on a similarity measure. A critical comparative evaluation of this new CNN medicinal plant classification model incorporating a mutual information guided training (MIGT) algorithm for sample selection, corroborates the superior classification performance achieved for the VNPlant-200 dataset, with an average accuracy of more than 97%, while the precision and recall values are also consistently above 97%. This is significantly better than existing CNN classification methods for this dataset as it crucially means false positive rates are substantially lower thus affording improved identification reliability. © 2022 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Medicinal plants; Mutual Information; Natural Environment; training dataset","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Neural network models; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Herbal plants; Medicinal plants; Mutual informations; Natural environments; Neural network model; Plant identification; Plant species; Training dataset; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Salman A., Semwal A., Bhatt U., Thakkar V.M., Leaf classifcation and identifcation using Canny Edge Detector and svm classifer, Proceedings of the International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control, ICISC 2017, pp. 1-4, (2017); Roopashree S., Anitha J., DeepHerb: A Vision Based System for Medicinal Plants Using Xception Features, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 135927-135941, (2021); Dileep M.R., Pournami P.N., AyurLeaf: A Deep Learning Approach for Classifcation of Medicinal Plants, IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON, vol, 2019, pp. 321-325, (2019); Jayanka M., Fernando T.G.I., Recognising Ayurvedic Herbal Plants in Sri Lanka using Convolutional Neural Networks, Vidyodaya Journal of Science, 23, pp. 48-60, (2020); Bojamma A.M., Shastry C., A study on the machine learning techniques for automated plant species identifcation: current trends and challenges, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 13, 3, pp. 989-995, (2021); Sun Y., Liu Y., Wang G., Zhang H., Deep Learning for Plant Identifcation in Natural Environment, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2017, (2017); Duong-Trung N., Quach L.D., Nguyen M.H., Nguyen C.N., A combination of transfer learning and deep learning for medicinal plant classifcation, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, vol.

Farmers raise a range of crops to meet their needs. Weather, soil conditions, disease, and other factors all have an impact on crop production. Plant diseases are one of the leading causes agricultural production and economic losses are both on the rise. Identifying plant disease is the initial step in averting some losses in agricultural output quantities. Plant disease identification is crucial for long-term agricultural viability, yet it’s manually monitoring plant diseases is tough. It necessitates a lot of labor, as well as knowledge of plant diseases and long processing times. The convolution neural networks (CNNs) used in this article performed exceptionally well in picture classification. The purpose of this research is to provide a fresh perspective to constructing a leaf blight recognition model based on leaf photo categorization. Deep convolution networks are utilized to do this. The proposed model is capable of distinguishing between plant leaves and their immediate environs, as well as healthy leaves and 13 various types of leaf diseases. The study details all of the steps involved in putting this disease recognition model into action, beginning with the collecting of pictures and the creation of a database that has been verified by agricultural experts.

In this article we will be discussing about techniques that are used to detect the diseases and damages caused to plant leaves. Detection of various kinds of diseases in plants helps farmers to produce good quality yield. This kind of evolution helps farmers to detect the diseased plants and resolve the damage in the starting stage itself before causing huge damage to healthy agriculture fields. We are using a CNN based approach to detect the problem. CNN is an architecture that is built on networks mainly focuses on Deep learning design and more precisely used for identification or recognition of images and gives us more accurate and precise results. As soon as we notice the underlying diseases in plants the loss can be scaled down and can be beneficial to farmers. The current work demonstrates how well the CNN model can be used to identify the different disorders in plant leaves. In this scenario the images were captured from the field areas, and some are taken from the pre-existing data set. Moreover, CNN we are comparing our model with KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a paradigm of supervised learning which is utilized for classification which classifies or anticipates how a specified data point will be classified using near point. Later this data set was implemented using Machine Learning techniques. Through such a comparison of the precision of images categorization using CNN and KNN. It is evident that when we employ CNN models rather than KNN for image classification, we receive results that are more precise. © 2023 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Image Classification; Machine Learning","Agriculture; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Plants (botany); CNN models; Convolutional neural network; Data set; Deep learning; Images classification; Leaf disease; Machine-learning; Modern agricultures; Nearest-neighbour; Plant leaves; Image classification","","","","","","","Prakash, Meena R., Saraswathy G.P., Ramalakshmi G., Mangaleswari K.H., Kaviya T., Detection of leaf diseases and classification using digital image processing, 2017 international conference on innovations in information, embedded and communication systems (ICIIECS), pp. 1-4, (2017); Kumar S., Prasad K.M.V.V., Srilekha A., Suman T., Pranav Rao B., Naga Vamshi Krishna J., Leaf disease detection and classification based on machine learning, 2020 International Conference on Smart Technologies in Computing, Electrical and Electronics (ICSTCEE), pp. 361-365, (2020); Vijai S., Misra A.K., Detection of unhealthy region of plant leaves using image processing and genetic algorithm, 2015 International Conference on Advances in Computer Engineering and Applications, pp. 1028-1032, (2015); Pushkara S., Hans P., Chand Gupta S., Classification of plant leaf diseases using machine learning and image preprocessing techniques, 2020 10th international conference on cloud computing, data science & engineering (Confluence), pp. 480-484, (2020); Mingjing P., Kong M., Fu M., Zhou X., Li Z., Xu J., Application research of plant leaf pests and diseases base on unsupervised learning, 2022 3rd International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning & International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications (CVIDL & ICCEA), pp. 1-4, (2022); Nalawade R., Nagap A., Jindam L., Ugale M., Agriculture field monitoring and plant leaf disease detection, 2020 3rd International Conference on Communication System, Computing and IT Applications (CSCITA), pp. 226-231, (2020); Ajra H., Khairun Nahar M., Sarkar L., Shohidul Islam M., Disease Detection of Plant Leaf using Image Processing and CNN with Preventive Measures, 2020 Emerging Technology in Computing, Communication and Electronics (ETCCE), pp. 1-6, (2020); Hari, Santhana S., Sivakumar M., Renuga P., Suriya S., Detection of plant disease by leaf image using convolutional neural network, 2019 International Conference on Vision Towards Emerging Trends in Communication and Networking (ViTECoN), pp. 1-5, (2019); Jiang P., Chen Y., Liu B., He D., Liang C., Real-time detection of apple leaf diseases using deep learning approachbased on improved convolutional neural networks, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 59069-59080, (2019); Li L., Zhang S., Wang B., Plant disease detection and classification by deep learning-a review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 56683-56698, (2021); Amin H., Darwish A., Ella Hassanien A., Soliman M., End-to-End Deep Learning Model for Corn Leaf Disease Classification, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 31103-31115, (2022); Zhao Y., Chen Z., Gao X., Song W., Xiong Q., Hu J., Zhang Z., Plant disease detection using generated leaves based on doubleGAN, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, (2021); Zeng Q., Ma X., Cheng B., Zhou E., Pang W., Gans-based data augmentation for citrus disease severity detection using deep learning, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 172882-172891, (2020); Kumar M.P., Varma Mudunuri R., Rajasekar B., Karthikeyan S., Image processing technique for automatic detection of plant diseases and alerting system in agricultural farms, 2020 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP), pp. 1603-1607, (2020); Ashok S., Kishore G., Rajesh V., Suchitra S., Gino Sophia S.G., Pavithra B., Tomato leaf disease detection using deep learning techniques, 2020 5th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES), pp. 979-983, (2020); Ajra H., Khairun Nahar M., Sarkar L., Shohidul Islam M., Disease Detection of Plant Leaf using Image Processing and CNN with Preventive Measures, Emerging Technology, (2020); Sahu M., Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks for Plant disease Identification, International Journal of Computer Communication and Informatics, 3, 2, pp. 51-62, (2021)","P.

There has been a disagreement over whether the leaves, fruits, flowers, or bark of the tree should be utilized to distinguish between species. Research has shown that bark is crucial because it persists during seasonal changes and gives trees their distinctive identities through structural variances. Using bark texture image to identify tree species is a difficult topic that could be helpful for many forestry-related jobs. Although recent developments of deep learning performed the outstanding outcome on common eyesight problems. This research presents a deep learning-based strategy for classifying 50 different categories of trees based upon the texture of their bark for that taken the dataset called BarkVN-50. This BarkVN-50 dataset is the largest values of trees bark that have been taken into account for bark classification thus far. Here in present experiment investigated the use feature extraction from the basic CNN model and pre-trained (Transfer learning techniques) models like VGG16, MobileNet and also compared the results of the all three models with their computation time and accuracies of each models.

On the largest regions in India, rice is cultivated as an essential food. It is observed that rice crops are strongly affected by diseases, that causes major loses in agriculture sector. Plant pathologists are searching for an accurate and reliable diagnosis method for rice plant disease. The machine learning has been used effectively in various areas of crop remote sensing, particularly in the classification of crop diseases. At present time, deep learning is a hot research topic for crop disease identification. In this research, we developed an efficient rice plant disease detection method based on convolution neural network approach. This paper focuses mainly on three well known rice diseases, namely, leaf smut and brown spot caused by fungus and bacterial leaf blight caused by bacteria. This article proposes an effective approach for recognition and identification of rice plant disease based on size, shape and color of lesions in the leaf image. The proposed model applies Otsu’s global thresholding technique to perform image binarization to remove background noise of the image. The proposed method based on fully connected CNN was trained using 4000 image samples of each diseased leaves and 4000 image samples of healthy rice leaves, to detect the three rice diseases. The analysis of result shows that the proposed fully connected CNN is fast and effective approach, which provides an accuracy of 99.7% on the dataset. This accuracy is significantly higher than that for existing plant disease recognition and classification approaches. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","CNN;

Using computers to correctly label plant diseases and insect pests is an important prerequisite for achieving accurate classification of plant diseases and insect pests and ensuring system performance. In order to improve the accuracy of computer classification of plant pests and diseases, this paper proposes an automatic pest identification method based on the Vision Transformer (ViT). In order to avoid training overfitting, the plant diseases and insect pests data sets are enhanced by methods such as Histogram Equalization, Laplacian, Gamma Transformation, CLAHE, Retinex-SSR, and Retinex-MSR. Then use the enhanced data set to train the constructed ViT neural network, so as to realize the automatic classification of plant diseases and insect pests. The simulation results show that the constructed ViT network has a test recognition accuracy rate of 96.71% on the plant disease and insect pest public data set Plant-Village, which is about 1.00% higher than the Plant disease and pest identification method based on traditional convolutional neural networks such as GoogleNet and EfficentNetV2. © SPIE.","Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Plant Disease and Insect Pest Identification; Vision Transformer","Agriculture; Automation; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Metadata; Statistical tests; Data augmentation; Data set; Deep learning; Identification method; Plant disease; Plant disease and insect pest identification; Plant diseases and insect pests; Plant pests; Retinex; Vision transformer; Classification (of information)","","","","","Fundamental Research Enhancement Program of Computer Science and Technology in Qilu University of Technology; Program for Youth Innovative Research Team in University of Shandong Province, (2019KJN010); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2019JZZY010313, 2019JZZY020124); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61701269, 61771289, 61832012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Shandong Academy of Sciences, SDAS, (2021JC02014); Shandong Academy of Sciences, SDAS","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 61701269, 61832012 and 61771289, the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province under Grants 2019JZZY010313 and 2019JZZY020124， the Program for Youth Innovative Research Team in University of Shandong Province under 2019KJN010, the Fundamental Research Enhancement Program of Computer Science and Technology in Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences) under Grant 2021JC02014.","Li L., Zhang S., Wang B., Plant Disease Detection and Classification by Deep Learning?A Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 56683-56698, (2021); Liu Q., Yan Q., Tian J., Yuan K., Key technologies and applications in intelligent agriculture, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1757, 1, (2021); Vaibhav Tiwari, Chandra Joshi Rakesh, Kishore Dutta Malay, Dense convolutional neural networks based multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images, Ecological Informatics, (2021); Loti N., Noor M., Chang S., Integrated analysis of machine learning and deep learning in chili pest and disease identification, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture; Chen C.

However, the recognition accuracy and robustness of the model depend mainly on the scale of the training dataset and the quality of annotation. Particularly, the image modal data is only used in DCNN recognition models. It is necessary to build a large-scale disease dataset and complete high-quality annotation in open environments. Nevertheless, the huge economic and technical costs have limited the promotion of DCNN recognition in practical applications. Inspired by multimodal learning, a crop disease recognition model was proposed in an open environment using a flexible image and text bimodal joint representation learning, called bimodalNet. The image-associated text information was brought into the disease recognition task. The input of the network was the image-text pair composed of disease image and description text. The disease images were clipped and adjusted to 224×224 pixels. The description character of the disease was Chinese. A series of operations was completed for the text embedding, including normalization, word segmentation, word list construction, and text vectorization. As such, the network structure consisted of two parts: image and text branches. CNN was used in the image branch to extract disease features from images, whereas, the circular neural network was used in the text branch to learn disease features from description text. The correlation and complementarity were utilized between the two modes of disease information, thereby realizing the joint representation learning of disease features in bimodalNet. The output of image and text branches were added, and then fused into the output of networks. Different image and text classifiers were used to meet the needs of various tasks. As such, the best combination of disease feature extraction was selected from six networks in the experiments. The experimental dataset consisted of 1 834 disease image-text pairs. Among them, the disease images were all taken in the field environment, where each image was given a text description. The dataset was divided into training, verification and test dataset, according to the ratio of 7:2:1. The bimodalNet achieved better performances, compared with either image modal or text modal training alone. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 value of the optimal model in the test dataset were 99.47%, 98.51%, 98.61%, 99.68%, and 98.51%, respectively. Experimental results showed that bimodalNet improved significantly the accuracy of crop disease recognition in an open environment, while reduced the technical and economic costs of a large number of disease image acquisition. The reason was that the complementary features were fully utilized between image and text modes. Specifically, the image mode was used to correct the text error description, whereas, the text mode was to correct fuzzy features in an image mode. Since bimodalNet can be expected to be a general framework in actual use, the image and text branches can be replaced with any excellent CNN and recurrent neural network structure, indicating high flexibility in network structure. The finding can provide high feasibility on the disease identification using multimodal and few samples in an open environment. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, it confronts a major challenge which is plant disease. Around 42% of the world's total crops are destroyed yearly by diseases. So, the identification of plant disease in an earlier stage is critical for minimizing the use of pesticides and reducing crop loss. This research is focusing on the recognition and classification of various tomato and pepper diseases based on Deep learning techniques. Two Convolutional neural networks (CNN) models Resnet 152 and Resnet 50 are used with and without data augmentation. This technique is used when the datasets are small, it expands the number of training images without adding new images. A self-dataset of 488 images of tomato and pepper diseases leaves are collected in Monastir, Tunisia region under the supervision of an agricultural engineer working in the field of plant protection in the Minister of Agriculture.

The image dataset is collected for the different pest species for tomato plant and corn crop, with minimum imbalance ratio. To find a solution to the problem of pest identification, deep learning techniques can be administered. So, the modified VGG16 model is applied to comprehensively extract multifaceted features in complex farmland backgrounds. Accumulated growing degree day (GDD) will help in providing the short-term forecasting of time of attack of pests in a particular region. The growing degree day (GDD) can be visualized on the Geographic Information System (GIS) application for getting better insights. The results achieved from the modified VGG16 model are comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, with an accuracy of 92.40%. The proposed system which combines the classification model and the pest vulnerability model will be helpful for the farmers in taking suitable, effective, and timely decisions related to control and management of pests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Geographic Information System (GIS); Growing degree day (GDD); Pest recognition; Weather data","Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Losses; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease detection; Geographic information system; Growing degree day; Growing degree-days; Learning approach; Pest recognition; Plant pests; Weather data; Geographic information systems","","","","","Computer Engineering and Information Technology Department of VJTI; Faculty Development Center; VJTI","The author gratefully acknowledges the support of the Faculty Development Center (VJTI) and Computer Engineering and Information Technology Department of VJTI, Mumbai, for providing research and experimental platform and would also appreciate the valuable feedback and comments from reviewers.","Peng Chen D.X., Jun Zhang B.W., Xie C., Insect Detection and Classification Based on an Improved Convolutional Neural Network”,Sensors, 18, (2018); Youhua Zhang X.C., Yunzhi Wu Y.C., Yue Y., Pest identification via deep residual learning in complex background, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 141, pp. 351-356, (2017); Yanjiang Wang L.D., Renshi Yu Z.H., Research on insect pest image detection and recognition based on bio-inspired methods, Biosystems Engineering, 169, (2018); Li Y., Wang H., Minh Dang L., Sadeghi-Niaraki A., Moon H., Crop pest recognition in natural scenes using convolutional neural networks, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020); Xiaoping W., Zhan C., Lai Y.-K., Cheng M.-M., Yang J., IP102: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Insect Pest Recognition”, IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (2019); Boniecki P., Koszela K., Piekarska-Boniecka H., Weres J., Zaborowicz M., Kujawa S., Majewski A., Raba B., Neural identification of selected apple pests, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 110, (2015); Bvl Narayana R.G., Krishna Reddy P., Ranga Rao G.V., Understanding Helicoverpa armigera Pest Population Dynamics related to Chickpea Crop Using Neural Networks, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM’03; Chormule A., Shejawal N., Sharanabasappa C.M.K., Asokan R., Mahadeva Swamy H.M., First report of the fall Armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.

However, it is difficult to diagnose maize disease on a wide scale due to a lack of human competency and limitations in standard image-recognition technologies. Fortunately, improvements in deep learning and machine learning technologies enable automatic disease identification. In this study, we proposed a 4-stage cascaded approach for the classification of Fusarium stalk rot and Charcoal rot in maize. In the proposed model, deep features are extracted by using three different convolutional neural network (CNN) models namely: GoogLeNet, ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 from the maize images which are preprocessed in the previous stage. The features extracted from these three CNN models are concatenated to benefit each CNN structure, and then the hybrid feature selection approach is utilized to choose the most relevant features with the lowest dimension to train the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The findings of the experiment reveal that the proposed cascade model can classify the diseased as well as healthy images with an accuracy of 97.95%. Furthermore, the suggested model performed better in terms of specificity, accuracy, and F1-Score, with values of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively. This study also presents a comparison of the performance of the proposed cascade model to that of several other relevant classification models. © 2023 The Authors","Bidirectional search; CNN; Data augmentation; Hybrid feature selection; Stalk rot; SVM classifier; Transfer learning","charcoal; accuracy; Article; charcoal rot; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; disease classification; feature extraction; feature selection; fungal rot; Fusarium; maize; model; nonhuman; sensitivity and specificity; stalk rot; support vector machine","","charcoal, 16291-96-6","","","","","Krishisewa; Maize diseases: a guide for field identification, (2004); Setiawan W., Pramudita Y.D., Rulaningtyas R., Modified-residual network for maize stalk rots diseases classification, Commun.Math.

The loss of food is primarily attributed to contaminated crops, which reflexively decreases the rate of development. The detection of plant disease within the field of agriculture is extremely difficult. When identification is incorrect then the assembly of the product and the market's economic value will suffer a significant loss. This research involves a new approach to model identification of plant diseases growth using large, convolution networks, based on the classification of the leaf image. Novel approach and technique used to promote the easy and simple implementation of the program in observance. The developed model can identify thirteen completely different kinds of plant diseases from healthy leaves, with the flexibility to tell apart from the surrounding plant leaves. This technique for the identification of diseases was projected for the first time according to our knowledge. All necessary steps were taken by agricultural consultants to incorporate this disease recognition model, beginning with the collection of photographs to make details.

In severe cases, it will cause a huge decline in blueberry yield and cause significant economic losses. The correct identification of mummy berry disease helps growers to take timely preventive measures, which can limit the further spread of mummy berry disease and reduce the damage to blueberries. In this paper, aiming at identifying mummy berry disease in a real environment, we propose a lightweight network model that can be deployed on mobile or embedded devices without worrying about the limitation of computational cost and memory storage capacity. This model selects MobileNet V1 as the basic network. The core convolution layer adopts a multi-scale feature extraction module proposed by us, namely MSFE module, which combines the dilated convolution and the depthwise separable convolution in a parallel manner. At the end of the model, the feature filtering module FFM based on channel attention mechanism is used to improve the classification performance of the model. The parameter size of the model is only 2.61 million, which is about 19.2% lower than that of MobileNet V1. Experiments show that the model has achieved a good classification effect on the mummy berry disease data set, with a test accuracy of 99.33%, which is 3.17% higher than the MobileNet V1 test accuracy. © 2022 The Authors","Attention mechanism; Blueberry; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Lightweight network; Mummy berry disease","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61871061)","We are grateful to several graduate students in the School of Biology and Ecology of the University of Maine for their efforts of taking field images.

India has always been the largest manufacturing country, dominated by agriculture. Cereals, fruits, and vegetables such as potatoes, oranges, tomatoes, sugar cane, other cereals, and cotton are the most important crops in India. Maharashtra's impressive economic growth is partly based on its diverse citrus and cotton industries. This situation has created jobs for many people and great potential for economic growth in the state. The government focused on disease control, labor costs, and global markets to keep the citrus and cotton industries thriving. Recently, citrus canker, lime green, and black spotted cotton have seriously threatened citrus trees in Maharashtra. These diseases cause tree dieback and death, reduced yields, and loss of marketability. Likewise, farmers worry about the cost of tree loss, exploration, and chemicals used to control the disease. Automated detection systems can help prevent and reduce significant losses to industry, farmers, and the country's economy. This study aims to detect these diseases in crops using pattern recognition methods. The recognition method comprises three main subsystems: image acquisition, processing, and pattern recognition. The images are pre-processed to eliminate any unwanted noise, then the sheets' boundaries are identified, and finally, any relevant features are extracted. Different culture conditions were utilized using pattern recognition techniques to categorize the samples. To evaluate the classification method, we compared the results of different classification methods for detecting diseases in fruits, vegetables, and cereals, achieving an accuracy of 90–95%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","CNN architectures; Deep learning; Plant diseases","Costs; Cotton; Deep learning; Disease control; Fruits; International trade; Lime; Sugar cane; Vegetables; Wages; Agricultural economy; Classification methods; CNN architecture; Deep learning; Economic growths; Food industries; Phase detection; Phase identification; Plant disease; State of the art; Crops","","","","","","","Zhao Y., Liu L., Xie C., Wang R., Wang F., Bu Y., Zhang S., An effective automatic system deployed in agricultural Internet of things using multi-context fusion network towards crop disease recognition in the wild, Appl Soft Comput, 89, (2020); Pydipati R., Burks T.F., Lee W.S., Statistical and neural network classifiers for citrus disease detection using machine vision, Rans ASAE, 48, 5, pp. 2007-2014, (2005); Sanyal P., Patel S.C., Pattern recognition method to detect two diseases in rice plants, Image Sci J, 56, 6, pp. 319-325, (2008); Kurniawati N., Abdullah S., Abdullah S., Abdullah S., Investigation on image processing techniques for diagnosing paddy diseases, 2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition, pp. 272-277, (2009); Camargo A., Smith J., An image-processing-based algorithm to automatically identify plant disease visual symptoms, Biosyst Eng, 102, 1, pp. 9-21, (2009); Story D., Kacira M., Kubota C., Akoglu A., An L., Lettuce calcium deficiency detection with machine vision computed plant features in controlled environments, Comput Electron Agric, 74, 2, pp. 238-243, (2010); Pugoy R., Mariano V., Automated rice leaf disease detection using color image analysis.

The recent advances in deep learning and image processing gives hope for the development of efficient algorithms to address this issue. In this manuscript, we make use of these schemes to develop a Light-Weight Convolutional Neural Network (LWCNN) for identifying diseases in the leaves and ears of pearl millets. Although many models exist in the literature, the total number of parameters employed by our model is far fewer, by an order of thousand as compared to many other light-weight networks such as MobileNet(v2), EfficientNet, NASNet etc. Hence our scheme can be employed and run directly on devices with much lesser compute power. It is noteworthy that despite using few parameters, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 97.4% in detecting the existence of the downy mildew disease in pearl millets, and takes the least time for both training and testing as compared to other models. To eliminate most of the pre-processing steps and to make our system suitable for on-field detection, we explore three single stage object detectors namely SSD, YOLOv3 and RetinaNet which localize and classify multiple instances of healthy and diseased leaves and ears in the image. We present a comparative analysis of the models and our experiments indicate that SSD is most suitable outperforming the other two models by a significant margin. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Crop Protection; Deep learning; Model interpretability; Object detection","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Object recognition; Plants (botany); Agricultural crops; Convolutional neural network; Crop protection; Crop yield; Deep learning; Interpretability; Light weight; Model interpretability; Pearl millet; Plant disease; Object detection","","","","","DST SYST; DST-SYST, (SP-YO-688-2018)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by DST-SYST (Scheme for Young Scientists and Technologist) funding, under Project Grant File No: SP-YO-688-2018. ; Funding text 2: The authors thank the DST SYST for funding this research work (Project Grant File No: SP-YO- 688-2018).

Timely and accurate identification and control can effectively improve the yield and quality of crops. A total of 15 types of data in the data set of Plant Village, including healthy pepper and plaque leaves, healthy potato early blight and late blight, and common tomato diseases, were selected for classification and recognition by using deep learning algorithm.

Traditional methods for detecting plant diseases are often time-consuming and require expert knowledge. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated great potential in the detection and classification of plant diseases. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for identifying 15 categories of plant leaf diseases, focusing on Tomato, Potato, and Bell pepper as the target plants. For our experiments, we utilized the publicly available PlantVillage dataset. The choice of a CNN for this task is justified by its recognition as one of the most popular and effective deep learning methods, especially for processing spatial data like images of plant leaves. We evaluated the performance of our model using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, yielding encouraging results in terms of disease identification accuracy and classification precision. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","CNN; Deep learning; Leaf disease classification; Plant disease","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Disease detection; Economic damages; Leaf disease; Leaf disease classification; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Yield loss; Data handling","","","","","","","Anand G., Rajeshkumar K.C., Challenges and threats posed by plant pathogenic fungi on agricultural productivity and economy, Fungal Diversity, Ecology and Control Management, pp. 483-493, (2022); Joshi M., Deshpande J.D., Polymerase chain reaction: Methods, principles and application, Int.

Crop production and yield in Ethiopia is greatly affected by plant diseases which cause loss of agricultural products every year. One of these plant diseases is chickpea disease which is a fungal disease. Ascochyta blight and Fusarium wilt are the most common chickpea diseases in Ethiopia that affect crop production quality and quantity. The identification of these diseases requires experienced experts or systems. Although numerous methods have been previously adopted in literature, deep learning (DL) is suggested as an efficient approach for disease recognition and classification since it can automatically learn features from the input image. In this paper, a chickpea disease detection model was developed using deep learning techniques by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for feature extraction and Softmax for classification. To develop the proposed model, various image preprocessing stages such as image resizing, normalization, and noise filtering using a combination of Gaussian filter (GF) and Median filter (MF) were performed. To prevent the problem of overfitting, augmentation was applied, while to train and test the effectiveness of the developed model, 8391 images were used. From the acquired images, 80% of the dataset was used for training, 20% of the dataset was used for testing and out of the 80% training data, 20% was used for validation. The proposed CNN-LSTM performed well in identifying chickpea disease, with an accuracy of 92.55%. According to the study's findings, the proposed CNN-LSTM outperforms existing methods. © 2022 The Authors","Ascochyta blight; Chickpea; CNN-LSTM; Deep learning; Fusarium wilt","Article; blight; chickpea;

Mali), resulting in serious economic losses to growers. Traditional methods for disease detection and severity classification mostly rely on manual labor, which is slow, labor-intensive and highly subjective. There is an urgent need to develop an effective protocol to rapidly and accurately evaluate disease severity. In this study, DeeplabV3+, PSPNet and UNet were used to assess the severity of apple Alternaria leaf blotch. For identifications of leaves and disease areas, the dataset with a total of 5382 samples was randomly split into 74% (4004 samples) for model training, 9% (494 samples) for validation, 8% (444 samples) for testing and 8% (440 samples) for overall testing. Apple leaves were first segmented from complex backgrounds using the deep-learning algorithms with different backbones. Then, the recognition of disease areas was performed on the segmented leaves. The results showed that the PSPNet model with MobileNetV2 backbone exhibited the highest performance in leaf segmentation, with precision, recall and MIoU values of 99.15%, 99.26% and 98.42%, respectively. The UNet model with VGG backbone performed the best in disease-area prediction, with a precision of 95.84%, a recall of 95.54% and a MIoU value of 92.05%. The ratio of disease area to leaf area was calculated to assess the disease severity. The results showed that the average accuracy for severity classification was 96.41%. Moreover, both the correlation coefficient and the consistency correlation coefficient were 0.992, indicating a high agreement between the reference values and the value that the research predicted. This study proves the feasibility of rapid estimation of the severity of apple Alternaria leaf blotch, which will provide technical support for precise application of pesticides. © 2022 by the authors.

Visual plant disease analysis is a modern technique to handle this problem, following recent developments in imaging. In this study, we look at the challenge of plant disease detection which is visually done for identification of plant disease. Plant disease images, in comparison with other types of photographic images, are likely to have randomly dispersed lesions, varied symptoms, and complex backgrounds, making discriminative information difficult to capture. To facilitate plant disease recognition research, we had taken the PlantVillage dataset with 13,347 images with 14 classes. Models were trained using the PlantVillage dataset. The performance of EfficientNet architecture for classifying the plant leaf disease was compared against ResNet-50, Inception V3, AlexNet, and Xception deep learning algorithms in this analysis. The outcomes of the test dataset revealed that B3 models of the EfficientNet architecture had the greatest accuracy of 99.90 percent when related to other deep learning algorithm in the dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","AlexNet; CNN; Deep learning; EfficientNet; Inception V3; ResNet-50; Xception","","","","","","","","Zhang Z., Liu H., Meng Z., Chen J., Deep learning-based automatic recognition network of agricultural machinery images, Comput Electron Agric, 166, (2019); Liu X., Min W., Mei S., Wang L., Jiang S., Plant disease recognition: A large-scale benchmark dataset and a visual region and loss reweighting approach, IEEE Trans Image Process, 30, pp. 2003-2015, (2021); Tan M., Le Q., Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks, International Conference on Machine Learning.

The automated identification of medicinal plant species to treat disease based on their structure is much required in pharmaceutical laboratories. Plant Species with a complex background in the field will make the detection and classification more difficult. In this paper, optimization of bacterial foraging technique has been employed towards medicinal plant prediction and classification architecture based on feed-forward neural network. It is capable of identifying both complex structures of medicinal plants. Feed-forward Neural Networks are considered to have good recognition accuracy compared to other machine learning approaches. Further bacterial foraging has been implemented to minimize the feature search space to the classifier and provides optimal features for the plant classification. The experimental outcomes of the proposed approach has been analysed by employing the medley dataset and evaluating the performance of the proposed approach with respect to dice similarity coefficient, Specificity and sensitivity towards medicinal plant classification. The findings are very positive, and further research will focus on using a large dataset and increased computing resources to examine how well deep-learning neural networks function in identifying medicinal plants for use in health care. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Following its success in other fields, DL techniques are increasingly being used to a broad variety of agricultural operations. Due to its intrinsic complexity, image-based plant disease detection is difficult to solve. Targeted management relies on more than just detection and requires accurate identification of each species. An automated disease detection system aids the farmer by providing a speedy and accurate diagnosis of plant illness. Accelerating agricultural diagnostics requires the development of an automated system for identifying plant leaf diseases. Using machine learning and image processing, the authors of this study outline a strategy for detecting leaf blight. A photo of a leaf may be fed into this framework. In a first processing stage, noise is eliminated from the leaf images. The mean filter may be used to get rid of noise. Histogram equalisation is a method for enhancing image quality. Segmentation is a technique used in photography to break a large image down into more manageable sections. This helps to establish the picture's limits. The image is broken up using the BIRCH (Balance Iterative Reducing and Clustering utilising Hierarchies) technique. For this purpose of feature extraction, fine grained classification model, a convolutional neural network is used. After that, the pictures are categorized using a variety of methods, one of which is RCNN (Region based Convolutional neural network). Using this approach, this study discovered the split ratio, computational time, and as a result RCNN has resulted in a high accuracy of 0.98 when detecting the leaf compared to other algorithms. © 2023 IEEE.","CNN; Computing Time; leaf detection; RCNN; Split Ratio","Agriculture; Automation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Computing time; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Leaf detection; Leaf disease detections; Learning techniques; Plant leaves; Region based convolutional neural network; Region-based; Split ratio; Iterative methods","","","","","","","Kumar P., Pailwan O., Bhausaheb J.M., Bhaskare P., Leaf disease detection using image processing, Int.

As a result, a lot of academics are very interested in studying automatic medicinal plant classification. A powerful classifier that can accurately categorize therapeutic plants in real time must be created. This article reviews the effectiveness and predictability of many machine learning and deep learning algorithms deployed in recent years to categorize plants using pictures of their leaves. This study contains image processing techniques for some classifiers that are used to recognize leaves and extract important leaf characteristics. Early plant disease identification is essential because plant diseases have an impact on the growth of their specific species. There are several Machine learning models that are used to identify and classify the signs of plant diseases, but recent advancements in Deep Learning, a subset of ML, seem to offer tremendous promise for improved accuracy. The ML and DL models used to categorize different plant leaves are thoroughly reviewed in this article. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India","Weeds are plants that grow on the field undesirably, thereby directly affecting the quality and production of the edible crops cultivated. The numerous methods by which weeds interfere with crop development and crop culture lead to a reduction in agricultural yields. They impede agricultural cultivation processes by competing for one or more plant growth components such as mineral nutrients, water, sun energy, and space. Strong neural networks have an advantage in distinguishing weeds and seedlings when compared to typical human characteristics (such as color, texture, and form), and they can clearly discriminate the background from the identified items to provide the impact of correct recognition. Deep learning (DL) approaches can be used to resolve or circumvent this weed control issue. These techniques require intense feature selection or identification, classify different weed kinds, and separate them from the beneficial crops that are grown. From the given training data of around 17,500 images for the training purpose of the DL model, the accuracy obtained was very high. After comparing multiple deep learning based models based on an open-source dataset (DeepWeeds), it was found that DenseNet121 had the greatest accuracy (97%), F1 score (0.97), and sensitivity (0.97). A straightforward and simple-to-use mobile Android application has been implemented. The user is required to upload an image of a plant from his/her mobile. The classification output, that is, the name of the weed identified is displayed on the mobile screen. This application will be very useful for farmers and agriculturists as they can use the app to detect if a plant is a weed, and if it’s a weed, they can find out which weed as well. Some weeds may serve a useful purpose (for example, medicinal purposes), hence, the detection of weeds would be very useful. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Gururaj H L, Radhika A D, Divya C D, Ravi Kumar V, Yu-Chen Hu;

For plant disease automatic identification, classification of plant leaf images based on deep learning algorithms is currently the most accurate and popular method. Existing methods rely on the collection of large amounts of image annotation data and cannot flexibly adjust recognition categories, whereas we develop a new image retrieval system for automated detection, localization, and identification of individual leaf disease in an open setting, namely, where newly added disease types can be identified without retraining. In this paper, we first optimize the YOLOv5 algorithm, enhancing recognition ability in small objects, which helps to extract leaf objects more accurately; secondly, integrating classification recognition with metric learning, jointly learning categorizing images and similarity measurements, thus, capitalizing on prediction ability of available image classification models; and finally, constructing an efficient and nimble image retrieval system to quickly determine leaf disease type. We demonstrate detailed experimental results on three publicly available leaf disease datasets and prove the effectiveness of our system. This work lays the groundwork for promoting disease surveillance of plants applicable to intelligent agriculture and to crop research such as nutrition diagnosis, health status surveillance, and more.

Sickness is common in plants exposed to several environmental conditions. This lowers crop quality. Due to recent weather changes, farmers' biggest issue is maximizing output quality and quantity. Diagnosing and treating crop diseases quickly maximizes agricultural productivity. Illnesses can reduce tomato crop yields, lowering farmers' income. To treat and control tomato leaf diseases, proper identification is crucial. Deep learning improved recognition accuracy. Artificial intelligence incorporates deep learning. Due to its self-directed learning and feature extraction benefits, academic and industry circles have been discussing it recently. Learning-based methods in plant leaf disease detection can speed up research, improve feature extraction, and loosen disease spot feature selection. To improve identification accuracy, deep learning now uses fuzzy rules to represent and manage fuzzy information. Using a deep neuro-fuzzy neural network, we classify rice plant illnesses. To extract complex features, the neuro-fuzzy network uses a fuzzy inference layer and a fuzzy pooling layer. Then classify them in the fully linked layer. A huge dataset of 8 types of infected and uninfected rice plant photos yielded a 96.9% identification accuracy for the moa del. Three performance indicators were also used. The trials show the benefits of employing NFNHDL to diagnose rice diseases.  © 2023 IEEE.","Deep learning; fuzzy inference layer; fuzzy rules; neuro-fuzzy; rice plant","Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Disease control; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forestry; Fruits; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Risk assessment; Deep learning; Disease detection; Features extraction; Fuzzy inference layer; Fuzzy inferencer; Identification accuracy; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy network; Plant disease; Rice plants; Fuzzy inference","","","","","","","Krishnamoorthy D., Parameswari V.L., Rice leaf disease detection via deep neural networks with t ransfer learning for early identification, Turk J Physiother Rehabil, 32, (2018); Azim M.A., Islam M.K., Rahman M.M., Jahan F., An effective feature ext raction method for rice leaf disease classification, TELKOMNIKA, 19, 2, pp. 463-470, (2021); Ebrahimi M.A., Khoshtaghaza M.H., Minaei S., Jamshidi B., Vision-based pest detection based on SVM classification method, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 137, pp. 52-58, (2017); Yin H., Gu Y.H., Park C., Park J., Yoo S.J., Transfer learningbased search model for hot pepper diseases and pests, Agriculture, 10, (2020); Ashwinkumar S., Rajagopal S., Manimaran V., Jegajothi B., Automated plant leaf disease detection and classification using optimal MobileNet based convolutional neural networks, Materials Today: Proceedings, 51, pp. 480-487, (2022); Chen S., Zhang K., Zhao Y., Sun Y., Ban W., Chen Y., Zhuang H., Zhang X., Liu J., Yang T., An approach for rice bacterial leaf st reak disease segmentation and disease severity est imation, Agriculture, 11, 5, (2021); Lu C., Gao S., Zhou Z., Maize disease recognition via fuzzy least square support vector machine, J.

Reduced yield due to plant diseases can lead to immeasurable economic losses. Therefore, the detection and classification of crop diseases are of great significance. Current existing classification methods based on the single convolutional neural network (CNN) are not satisfactory for plant disease classification performance in a large number of classes. In this case, a CNN-based approach named multiclass plant EnsembleNet (MCPE) is proposed to address these problems. MCFN firstly adopts a data augmentation strategy-based AutoAugment enhance dataset. Next, an EnsembleNet including four CNNs is employed to classify plant species, with a new activation function, concatenated dynamic ReLU, which has better performance than conventional ReLU in the multiclass plant disease dataset. Then, training a diseases classifier for each plant, which is used to identify the types and severity of plant diseases. Experimental results on 61 plant diseases from 10 different plant species, over 40 000 images, show that MCFN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in multiclass plant disease recognition and achieves a good identification accuracy of 97.5%. We believe that the method described in this paper can further improve the identification efficiency of plant diseases, thus providing a basis for the identification of other plant leaf diseases.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Convolution neural network; crop disease; deep learning; image classification","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep neural networks; Losses; Convolution neural network; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Deep learning; Disease classification; Images classification; Leaf images; Plant disease; Plant species; Image classification","","","","","","","Abadi M., Agarwal A., Barham P., Brevdo E., TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems, (2016); Andrea C., Daniel B.

Traditional detection methods rely on manual vision to distinguish between types of disease infection, but this is time consuming, laborious and inaccurate. To address this problem, this paper proposes a deep learning-based attentional network model (SEV-Net) for plant disease severity identification and classification. The network embeds the improved channel and spatial attention module into the residual block of ResNet. The proposed attention module reduces the redundancy of information between channels and focuses on the most information-rich regions of the feature map. In this experiment, SEV-Net achieved an accuracy of 97.59% and 95.37% for multiple and single plant (Tomato) disease severity classification, which was better than existing attentional networks (SE-Net and CBAM). Moreover, the combination of visualization techniques showed that SEV-Net was adept at distinguishing small variations between plant diseases, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the network. Furthermore, we have also designed and developed an Android application for real-time classification of plant disease severity. The system deploys the SEV-Net network model, which has higher classification accuracy and faster recognition speed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","attention mechanism; mobile application; plant disease identification; residual connections","Android applications; Attention mechanisms; Classification accuracy; Detection methods; Network modeling; Recognition speed; Spatial attention; Visualization technique; Deep learning","","","","","Machine Intelligence and Vision Lab of Zhejiang University of Science and Technology in Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61605173); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (2019C54005, LY16C130003); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0126100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province, (61,403,346); Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Science and technology project of Zhejiang Province, grant number 2019C54005, National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 61605173 and 61,403,346, Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, grant number LY16C130003.

However, this requires a large amount of plant disease data, which is often not readily available, and the cost of acquiring disease images is high. Thus, developing a generalized model for recognizing unseen classes is very important and remains a major challenge to date. Existing methods solve the problem with general supervised recognition tasks based on the seen composition of the crop and the disease. However, ignoring the composition of unseen classes during model training can lead to a reduction in model generalisation. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new approach that leverages the visual features of crop and disease from the seen composition, using them to learn the features of unseen crop-disease composition classes. We show that our proposed method can improve the classification performance of these unseen classes and outperform the state-of-the-art in the identification of multiple crop-diseases. © 2023 IEEE.","Feature generation; Plant disease identification; Unseen instances","Computer vision; Deep learning; Crop disease; Feature generation; Feature learning; Generalized models; Large amounts; Large-scales; Plant disease; Plant disease identification; Task-based; Unseen instance; Crops","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) MoHE Grant (Ref: FRGS/1/2021/ICT02/SWIN/03/2), from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia; and we gratefully acknowledged the support of NEUON AI with the GPU workstation used for this research.","Han Lee S., Loong Chang Y., Seng Chan C., Remagnino P., Hgo-cnn: Hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network for multi-organ plant classification, 2017 IEEE international conference on image processing (ICIP).

Furthermore, households in poor countries may depend on small-scale corn cultivation for their basic needs. However, corn crops are vulnerable to diseases, which greatly affects farming yields. Moreover, extreme weather conditions and unseasonable temperatures can accelerate the spread of diseases. The pervasiveness and ubiquity of technology have allowed for the deployment of technological innovations in many areas. Particularly, applications powered by artificial intelligence algorithms have established themselves in many disciplines relating to image, signal, and sound recognition. In this work, we target the application of deep transfer learning in the classification of three corn diseases (i.e., Cercospora leaf spot, common rust, and northern leaf blight) in addition to the healthy plants. Using corn leaf image as input and convolutional neural networks models, no preprocessing or explicit feature extraction was required. Transfer learning using well-established and well-designed deep learning models was performed and extensively evaluated using multiple scenarios for splitting the data. In addition, the experiments were repeated 10 times to account for variability in picking random choices. The four classes were discerned with a mean accuracy of 98.6%. This and the other performance metrics exhibit values that make it feasible to build and deploy applications that can aid farmers and plant pathologists to promptly and accurately perform disease identification and apply the correct remedies. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; corn; deep learning; leaf blight; leaf spot; maze; rust","","","","","","","","Storey G., Meng Q., Li B., Leaf Disease Segmentation and Detection in Apple Orchards for Precise Smart Spraying in Sustainable Agriculture, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Mahlein A.K., Plant Disease Detection by Imaging Sensors–Parallels and Specific Demands for Precision Agriculture and Plant Phenotyping, Plant Dis, 100, pp. 241-251, (2016); Kumar K.K., Goddu J., Prasad P.S., Senthilrajan A., Rao L.V.K., An Efficient Approach for Identification of Multi-plant Disease Using Image Processing Technique, Computer Networks, Big Data and IoT, pp. 317-325, (2022); Rahman C.R., Arko P.S., Ali M.E., Khan M.A.I., Apon S.H., Nowrin F., Wasif A., Identification and recognition of rice diseases and pests using convolutional neural networks, Biosyst.

The seventieth population of Asian countries depends on agriculture. The identification of plant leaf diseases is typically carried out with the inspection by masters and organic tests. Both techniques are manual, costly and time-consuming. Detecting plant leaf diseases is a challenging task since it involves numerous variables such as genotype, environment, and their interplay. Accurate detection of plant leaf diseases involves a fundamental understanding of functional relativity and the collaborative factors. Deep learning helps in recognition of plant diseases and it provides earlier and timely detection of plant diseases for efficient disease management. It expresses a different infusion that gives systematic and automated detection of diseases. A convolutional neural network model is designed to use for detection of leaf spot diseases in plants. A tomato plant disease dataset has been generated from the local farms of Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh, India. The tomato leaf spot diseases considered for training are Septoria leaf spot, bacterial spot, target spot and leaf mold which are most popular diseases in tomato plants. The average classification accuracy of the proposed model is determined to be 90.6%. For comparative analysis, the proposed CNN model has been experimentally evaluated with Multilayer perceptron classifier model. The proposed model produced an effective average MSE and R2 values of 0.016 and 0.991. The MLP model produced less optimal results than the proposed model thus confirming the efficacy of the proposed model in classifying the plant leaf diseases.  © 2022 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Image Processing; Leaf Disease Detection; Leaf Spot Diseases; Plant Diseases","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fruits; Image processing; Asian countries; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Images processing; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Leaf spot disease; Plant disease; Plant leaves; Tomato plants; Neural network models","","","","","","","Sunitha G., Arunachalam R., Abd-Elnaby M., Rashed Zaki Nabih Ahmed Eid A M.M, A Comparative Analysis of Deep Neural Network Architectures for the Dynamic Diagnosis of COVID-19 Based on Acoustic Cough Features, International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, pp. 1-14, (2022); Sunitha G., Pushpalatha M.N., Parkavi A., Boyapati P., Walia R., Kohar R., Qureshi K., Modeling of Chaotic Political Optimizer for Crop Yield Prediction, Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, 34, 1, pp. 423-437, (2022); Sunitha G., Geetha K., Neelakandan S., Hemalatha S.

The country's rural development is depending on the productivity of crops. Specialists frequently inspect the plants to locate and identify illnesses. This approach, however, is typically time-consuming, expensive, and prone to mistakes. Automatic identification is essential. As an alternative to the usual time-consuming cycle, various research projects aim to discover viable methods for securing plants. Recently, advancements in invention have resulted in a few alternatives to traditional tedious methods. In order to allow the model to discriminate between sick and healthy leaves or between different climates, the strong leaves and foundational images are processed with various classifications. In classification challenges, advanced deep learning approaches are particularly helpful.

In soybean crops, annual losses are estimated at 10.6% of the world production. Besides, the identification of these species through microscopic analysis by an expert with taxonomic knowledge is often laborious, time-consuming, and susceptible to failure. From this perspective, robust and automatic approaches are necessary for identifying phytonematodes that are capable of providing correct diagnoses for the classification of species and subsidizing of all control and prevention measures. This work presents a new public data set called NemaDataset containing 3063 microscopic images from five nematode species with the most significant damage relevance for the soybean crop. Additionally, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model defined as NemaNet and present a comparative assessment with thirteen popular models of CNNs, all of them representing state-of-the art classification and recognition. The general average was calculated for each model, on a from-scratch training; the NemaNet model reached 96.76% accuracy, while the best evaluation fold reached 98.04%. When training with transfer learning was performed, the average accuracy reached 98.82%. The best evaluation fold reached 99.35%, and overall accuracy improvements of over 6.83% and 4.1%, for from-scratch and transfer learning training, respectively, compared to other popular models were achieved. © 2021 IAgrE","CNN; Deep learning; Phytonematodes; Plant disease; Plant pathogen; Plant-parasitic nematode","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Losses; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Large-scales; Neural network model; Phytonematode; Plant disease; Plant pathogen; Plant-parasitic nematodes; Scale economics; Transfer learning; Crops","","","","","Federal University of the State of Mato Grosso - Campus of Araguaia; Nvidia","The authors express their gratitude and acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation for their donation of the GPU Titan Xp used for this research and the technical support of the Laboratory of Phytopathology of the Federal University of the State of Mato Grosso - Campus of Araguaia.","Abade A., de Almeida A.S., Vidal F., Plant diseases recognition from digital images using multichannel convolutional neural networks, Proceedings of the 14th International joint conference on computer vision, imaging and computer graphics theory and applications, 5, pp. 450-458, (2019); Abade A., Ferreira P.A., de Barros Vidal F., Plant diseases recognition on images using convolutional neural networks: A systematic review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 185, (2021); Abadi M., Agarwal A., Barham P., Brevdo E., Chen Z., Citro C., Corrado G.S., Davis A., Dean J., Devin M., Ghemawat S., Goodfellow I., Harp A., Irving G., Isard M., Jia Y., Jozefowicz R., Kaiser L., Kudlur M., Zheng X., TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, (2015); Agrios G., Plant pathology, (2005); Arnal Barbedo J.G., Digital image processing techniques for detecting, quantifying and classifying plant diseases, SpringerPlus, 2, (2013); Askary T.H., Limitations, research needs and future prospects in the biological control of phytonematodes, Biocontrol Agents of Phytonematodes, pp. 446-454, (2015); Barbedo J.G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosystems Engineering, 144, pp. 52-60, (2016); Barreto S.C., Lambert J.A., de Barros Vidal F., Using synthetic images for deep learning recognition process on automatic license plate recognition, Pattern recognition, pp. 115-126, (2019); Bernard G.C., Egnin M., Bonsi C., The impact of plant-parasitic nematodes on agriculture and methods of control, Nematology, pp. 20-35, (2017); Bos L., Parlevliet J.E., Concepts and terminology on plant/pest relationships: Toward consensus in plant pathology and crop protection, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 33, pp. 69-102, (1995); Cao Y., Liu S., Peng Y., Li J., Denseunet: Densely connected unet for electron microscopy image segmentation, IET Image Processing, 14, pp. 2682-2689, (2020); Chen L., Strauch M., Daub M., Jiang X., Jansen M., Luigs H., Schultz-Kuhlmann S., Krussel S., Merhof D., A cnn framework based on line annotations for detecting nematodes in microscopic images, 2020 IEEE 17th International symposium on biomedical imaging, pp. 508-512, (2020); Chollet F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, 2017 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 1800-1807, (2017); Chollet F., Keras, (2015); Chollet F., Keras api references - preprocessing layers, (2021); CONAB C.N.D.A., Conab - Boletim da Safra de Grãos, (2020); Coolen W.A., D'herde C.J., A method for the quantitative extraction of nematodes from plant tissue.

To increase agricultural productivity effectively, fast and precise disease diagnosis is essential. Farmers face a drag like water shortage, fertility problems, pests, disease attacks, low yield, and sort of monetary problems. Farmers use the normal method for locating these problems. But those techniques aren't much effective. Detection of the disease in its initial phase will help in preventing the loss of crops, improve the productivity of plants, and therefore the quality of the products. To solve agricultural issues image processing techniques can be used. Deep Learning includes a cutting-edge image processing approach. This involves putting present work in the area of agricultural leaf disease identification and diagnosis utilizing Deep Learning algorithms in its proper context. This study looks at the latest developments and issues in using Deep Learning and advanced picture processing technologies to identify crop leaf disease. The survey looks at the various agricultural problems being researched, the models utilized, the sources of information used, and the total precision attained using the researchers' performance criteria. By enhancing system reliability and efficiency, the creation of this review enables longer-term study to identify deeper capabilities of Deep Learning when detecting and categorizing crop diseases. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Image Processing Techniques.; Plant Leaf Disease Identification","Crops; Cutting; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Agricultural productivity; Crop disease; Deep learning; Image processing technique; Image processing technique.; Leaf disease; Plant leaf disease identification; Plant leaves; Precise disease diagnosis; Water shortages; Productivity","","","","","","","Barbedo J.G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosyst.

Plant diseases can damage farming, reducing harvest yields. This immediately affects farmers' income and human health. Plant disease identification is one of the world's most extensive challenges for farmers. Thus, leaf disease identification is vital in agriculture. Traditional disease detection approaches are difficult to detect in large numbers of plant leaf infectious illnesses. The ability to identify plant leaf diseases using images is rapidly improving. However, processing plant leaf images is difficult due to their complicated structure and shape. While modern deep learning algorithms can categorize and diagnose plant sickness, preparing plant leaf images is widely acknowledged as the most important and hardest step. Preprocessing has a big impact on the final results of deep learning. However, the proposed vision-based approaches efficiently detect and observe illness's external aspects. We have used the New Plant Diseases Dataset in our paperwork. We proposed deep learning with a specially trained convolutional neural network (CNN), which can aid in the classification of plant leaf images. Our approach makes use of a CNN architecture that was trained on a collection of these plant leaf images. This method accurately classifies plant leaf images into 38 types of plant leaf diseases with 99.29% test accuracy, outperforming approaches previously defined as state-of-The-Art.  © 2022 IEEE.","Classification; CNN; Plant Leaf Disease; Plant Village; Recognition","Convolution; Deep learning; Diseases; Farms; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Convolutional neural network; Energy supplies; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Plant leaf disease; Plant leaf images; Plant leaves; Plant village; Recognition; Recognition systems; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Hubert B., Rosegrant M., Van Boekel M.A., Ortiz R., The future of food: Scenarios for 2050, Crop Science, 50, pp. S-33, (2010); Mondal M.H., Crop agriculture of bangladesh: Challenges and opportunities, Bangladesh Journal of Agricultural Research, 35, 2, pp. 235-245, (2010); Shepherd M., Turner J.A., Small B., Wheeler D., Priorities for science to overcome hurdles thwarting the full promise of the adigital agriculturearevolution, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 100, 14, pp. 5083-5092, (2020); Iqbal Z., Khan M.A., Sharif M., Shah J.H., Ur Rehman M.H., Javed K., An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Sabiiti E.N., Utilising agricultural waste to enhance food security and conserve the environment, African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development, 11, 6, (2011); Islam M.A., Reduced Dataset Neural Network Model for Manuscript Character Recognition, (2020); Chauhan R., Ghanshala K.K., Joshi R., Convolutional neural network (cnn) for image detection and recognition, 2018 First International Conference on Secure Cyber Computing and Communication (ICSCCC, pp. 278-282, (2018); Ferentinos K.P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018); Aqel D., Al-Zubi S., Mughaid A., Jararweh Y., Extreme learning machine for plant diseases classification: A sustainable approach for smart agriculture, Cluster Computing, 25, 3, pp. 2007-2020, (2022); Sladojevic S., Arsenovic M., Anderla A., Culibrk D., Stefanovic D., Deep neural networks based recognition of plant diseases by leaf image classification, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2016, (2016); Nagaraju M., Chawla P., Upadhyay S., Tiwari R., Convolution network model based leaf disease detection using augmentation techniques, Expert Systems, 39, 4, (2022); Panchal P., Raman V.C., Mantri S., Plant diseases detection and classification using machine learning models, 2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS), 4, pp. 1-6, (2019); Jasim M.A., Al-Tuwaijari J.M., Plant leaf diseases detection and classification using image processing and deep learning techniques, 2020 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSASE, pp. 259-265, (2020); Saleem M.H., Potgieter J., Arif K.M., Plant disease detection and classification by deep learning, Plants, 8, 11, (2019); Sagar A., Dheeba J., On using transfer learning for plant disease detection, BioRxiv, (2020); Akshai K., Anitha J., Plant disease classification using deep learning, 2021 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICPSC, pp. 407-411, (2021); Bhattarai S., New Plant Diseases Dataset; Perez L., Wang J., The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification Using Deep Learning, (2017); Islam M.S., Hasan M.M., Rahim M.A., Hasan A.M., Mynuddin M., Khandokar I., Islam M.J., Machine learning-based music genre classification with pre-processed feature analysis, Jurnal Ilmiah Teknik Elektro Komputer Dan Informatika (JITEKI, 7, 3, pp. 491-502, (2021); Bala D., Childhood pneumonia recognition using convolutional neural network from chest x-ray images, Journal of Electrical Engineering, Electronics, Control and Computer Science, 7, 4, pp. 33-40, (2021); Parhi R., Nowak R.D., The role of neural network activation functions, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 27, pp. 1779-1783, (2020); Ho Y., Wookey S., The real-world-weight cross-entropy loss function: Modeling the costs of mislabeling, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 4806-4813, (2019); Kingma D.P., Ba J., Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, (2014)","D.

When real-life problems are considered, the above technology processes are essential in solving the issues. Food is an essential need of human beings. Food supply has become crucial, and it is very important to increase the adequate cultivation of plants for large populations due to huge population growth. At the same time, farmers are struggling with a variety of food plant diseases that significantly affect the harvesting and production in agricultural fields. Nevertheless, the agricultural productivity of rural areas is directly involved with the increase in the economic growth of developing countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar and Indonesia. Early identification of crop disease, using a well-established modern technique, is vital. It necessitates a number of processes observing large-scale agricultural fields as a disease can infect different parts of the plant such as leaf, roots, stem and fruit. Most diseases appear in plant leaves and have the potential to spread them all over the field within a very short time. This paper reviews several state-of-the-art methods that can be used for plant leaf disease recognition with a special reference to deep learning based methods.  © 2021 IEEE.","attention mechanism; Deep Learning; disease identification; image processing; Machine Learning","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Developing countries; Image classification; Internet of things; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Productivity; Agricultural fields; Attention mechanisms; Crop leaves; Deep learning; Disease identification; Images processing; Leaf disease; Learning approach; Machine-learning; Plant leaves; Food supply","","","","","","","Yang G., He Y., Yang Y., Xu B., Fine-grained image classification for crop disease based on attention mechanism, Front.

The mis-interpretations of plant diseases often lead to wrong pesticide selection, resulting in damage of crops. Hence, the automatic recognition of the diseases at earlier stages is important as well as economical for better quality and quantity of fruits. Computer aided detection (CAD) has proven as a supportive tool for disease detection and classification, thus allowing the identification of diseases and reducing the rate of degradation of fruit quality. In this research work, a model based on convolutional neural network with 19 convolutional layers has been proposed for effective and accurate classification of Marsonina Coronaria and Apple Scab diseases from apple leaves. For this, a database of 50,000 images has been acquired by collecting images of leaves from apple farms of Himachal Pradesh (H.P) and Uttarakhand (India). An augmentation technique has been performed on the dataset to increase the number of images for increasing the accuracy. The performance analysis of the proposed model has been compared with the new two ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) models having 8 and 9 layers respectively. The proposed model has also been compared with the standard machine learning classifiers like support vector machine, k-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models. From experimental results, it has been observed that the proposed model has outperformed the other CNN based models and machine learning models with an accuracy of 99.2%. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Accurate and rapid illness prediction for early illness treatment to crops minimizes economical loss to the individual and further proves to be productive for healthy crops. Many studies use modern deep learning approaches to improve the accuracy and performance of object detection and identification systems. The suggested method notifies farmers of different agricultural illnesses, prompting them to take further essential precautions before the disease spreads to the whole agricultural field. The primary objective of this study is to detect the illnesses as soon as they begin to spread on the leaves of the plants. Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and Bicubic models are employed in the system to identify healthy and diseased leaves with an accuracy of 99.175 % and 99.156 % respectively. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long‐term agriculture sus-tainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image‐processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down‐sampled using a Logistic Regression tech-nique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state‐of‐the‐art classifiers after 92 epochs. Based on the simulation findings, an appropriate classifier for this application is also suggested. The proposed technique’s effectiveness is confirmed by a fair comparison to existing procedures. © 2022 by the authors.

Agriculture produces fabrics, wool, cotton, and leather in addition to food. Agriculture affects more than 65 percent of the world's population, either directly or indirectly. For many individuals, it is their main source of income. It accounts for a substantial portion of global GDP. Farmers, however, despite spending a lot of money, are unable to produce enough quantities and quality food owing to poor weather conditions and other issues. Farmers have difficulty in detecting illness in plants, and farmers also face challenges in managing these diseases. Plant classification/recognition, fruit classification/counting, weed classification/counting, disease identification, and other agricultural topics are covered in this chapter. We also go through different deep learning methods such as CNN, RNN, and GAN, as well as preset networks like as VGG and ResNet, and solutions to specific agricultural issues. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Afonso M., Fonteijn H., Fiorentin F.S., Lensink D., Mooij M., Faber N., Polder G., Wehrens R., Tomato fruit detection and counting in greenhouses using deep learning., Frontiers in Plant Science, 11, (2020); Durmus H., Gunes E.O., Kirci M., Disease detection on the leaves of the tomato plants by using deep learning., 2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics, pp. 1-5, (2017); Fawakherji M., Youssef A., Bloisi D., Pretto A., Nardi D., Crop and Weeds Classification for Precision Agriculture Using Context-Independent Pixel-Wise Segmentation., 2019 Third IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC), pp. 146-152, (2019); Grinblat G.L., Uzal L.C., Larese M.G., Granitto P.M., Deep learning for plant identification using vein morphological patterns., Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 127, pp. 418-424, (2016); Gu L., He F., Yang S., Crop Classification based on Deep Learning in Northeast China using SAR and Optical Imagery., 2019 SAR in Big Data Era (BIGSARDATA), pp. 1-4, (2019); Ji S., Zhang C., Xu A., Shi Y., Duan Y., 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Crop Classification with Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images., Remote sensing, 10, 2, (2018); Knoll F.J., Czymmek V., Poczihoski S., Holtorf T., Hussmann S., Improving the efficiency of organic farming by using a deep learning classification approach., Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 347-356, (2018); Krizhevsky A., Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks., Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2012); Kulkarni O., Crop disease detection using deep learning., 2018 Fourth International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), pp. 1-4, (2018); Kumar S., Jain A., Shukla A.P., Singh S., Raja R., Rani S., A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Detection of Organic and Nonorganic Cotton Diseases,, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2021, (2021); MehdipourGhazi M., Yanikoglu B., Aptoula E., Plant identification using deep neural networks via optimization of transfer learning parameters., Neurocomputing, 235, pp. 228-235, (2017); Mohanty S.P., Hughes D.P., Salathe M., Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection., Frontiers in plant science, 7, (2016); Muresan H., Oltean M., Fruit recognition from images using deep learning., Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Informatica, 10, 1, pp. 26-42, (2018); Pallagani V., Khandelwal V., Chandra B., Udutalapally V., Das D., Mohanty S.P., dCrop: A Deep-Learning Based Framework for Accurate Prediction of Diseases of Crops in Smart Agriculture., 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Smart Electronic Systems (iSES) (Formerly iNiS), pp. 29-33, (2019); Rahnemoonfar M., Sheppard C., Deep count: fruit counting based on deep simulated learning., Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 17, 4, (2017); Yalcin H., Razavi S., Plant classification using convolutional neural networks., 2016 Fifth International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics), pp. 1-5, (2016)","P.C.

Especially rice is the primary stable food widely cultivated and consumed by 50% of the Indian population. Paddy crop is susceptible to several diseases like other crops that indirectly affect agricultural development and economic loss. To address this limitation, in this study, we have applied deep learning algorithms for the recognition and classification of diseases at an earlier stage. The paddy plant disease diagnosis is made by applying image processing techniques to identify the changes in leaves and its texture. We have used pre-processing techniques for segmentation, feature extraction and classification of disease. First, we have to perform data augmentation to improve the number of images in the dataset. Second, the segmentation of plant leaves are performed to identify the test infected region. Then, we applied CNN algorithm to extract features from the data. After feature extraction, we trained different classification algorithms to recognize and classify the images into disease and non-disease images. The application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms helps in the precise location and identification of infectious leaves that help farmers to use automated methods for disease diagnosis.  © 2023 IEEE.","Augmentation; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Disease Classification; Feature Extraction; Paddy leaves","Classification (of information); Crops; Data mining; Deep learning; Extraction; Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Losses; Plants (botany); Textures; Agricultural development; Augmentation; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Economic loss; Features extraction; Leaf images; Paddy leaf; Plant disease diagnosis; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Oo A.Z., Sudo S., Inubushi K., Mano M., Yamamoto A., Ono K., Osawa T., Hayashida S., Patra P.K., Terao Y., Elayakumar P., Vanitha K., Umamageswari C., Jothimani P., Ravi V., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from conventional and modified rice cultivation systems in South India, Agric.

Abiotic and biotic elements such as weather, soil fertility, temperature, pests, pathogens, viruses, and others influence rice grain yields production amount and quality. Farmers invest a lot of time and energy in disease control, and they detect diseases with their penniless human eye strategy, which causes unhealthy cultivation. To avoid biased, incorrect, and inefficient manual detection, we are introducing an automatic plant disease recognition and classification method by using a transfer learning technique. The deep neural networks algorithm is a convolutional learning technique that has been successfully used for computer vision problems like as image processing, object identification, and image identification.

Coconut trees, on the other hand, are subject to a variety of diseases that can severely diminish yield and even cause mortality. Deep learning approaches have yielded promising achievements in the field of picture recognition and classification in recent years. In this study, a deep learning-based approach is proposed for identifying coconut tree diseases. Based on photographs of the tree leaves, the system is conceived and developed to automatically diagnose the disease affecting the coconut tree. The proposed system consists of three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. To increase the quality of the input image, the pre-processing stage includes image scaling, normalisation, and enhancement. A deep convolutional neural network is used in the feature extraction stage to extract useful features from the pre-processed image. Finally, a softmax classifier is used in the classification stage to categorise the retrieved features into several types of coconut tree diseases. The suggested system is tested using a publically accessible dataset of coconut tree disease photos, and the experimental findings show that the proposed system is effective and efficient at accurately recognising the diseases that harm coconut plants. The suggested approach can be utilised by farmers, researchers, and agricultural specialists to quickly and reliably diagnose diseases affecting coconut trees, resulting in early and effective disease control and prevention measures.  © 2023 IEEE.","Control and prevention; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning techniques; Disease identification; Image recognition","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Disease control; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Coconut trees; Control and prevention; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning technique; Disease identification; Learning approach; Learning techniques; Learning-based approach; Pre-processing; Tropical countries; Image recognition","","","","","","","Gondal M., Khan Y., Early pest detection from crop using image processing and computational intelligence, FAST-NU Research Journal, 1, 1, pp. 59-68, (2015); Fernando P., Integrated management of major coconut pests and diseases in Sri Lanka, International Coconut Community, pp. 134-149; Kumara T., Muniyappa C., Kandakoor S., Chakravarthy A., Status and Management of Three Major Insect Pests of Coconut in the Tropics and Subtropics, New horizons in insect science: Towards sustainable pest management, pp. 359-381, (2015); Miranda J., Gerardo B., Tanguilig B., Pest ident ification using image processing techniques in detecting image pattern through neural network, International Conference on Advances in Computer and Elect ronics Technology, pp. 43-48, (2014); Sima M.T., Felix J.W., Alegria M.G., Ortiz M.A., Monroy D.J., Ruiz D.M., Lopez M., Tah R.G., Canche B.C., Berezovski M.V., Flores I.I., Potential of Omics to Control Diseases and Pests in the Coconut Tree, MDPI Education, 7, 3, (2021); Anitha B., Santhi S., Disease Prediction in Coconut Leaves using Deep Learning, 2023 International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Data Communication Systems (ICSCDS), IEEE, pp. 258-264, (2023); Vijayakumar T., Santhi S., Gokila M., A Deep Learning-based Approach for Tomato Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification, 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC), IEEE, pp. 1251-1255, (2022); Gokila M., Santhi S., A Review on Deep Learning Technique on Basis of Different Types of Crop Diseases, International Conference on Computing, Communication, Electrical and Biomedical Systems.

Currently, many neural network models have shown better performance in plant disease identification. Typically, the performance improvement of the model needs to be achieved by increasing the depth of the network. However, this also increases the computational complexity, memory requirements, and training time, which will be detrimental to the deployment of the model on mobile devices. To address this problem, a novel lightweight convolutional neural network has been proposed for plant disease detection. Skip connections are introduced into the conventional MobileNetV3 network to enrich the input features of the deep network, and the feature fusion weight parameters in the skip connections are optimized using an improved whale optimization algorithm to achieve higher classification accuracy. In addition, the bias loss substitutes the conventional cross-entropy loss to reduce the interference caused by redundant data during the learning process. The proposed model is pre-trained on the plant classification task dataset instead of using the classical ImageNet for pre-training, which further enhances the performance and robustness of the model. The constructed network achieved high performance with fewer parameters, reaching an accuracy of 99.8% on the PlantVillage dataset. Encouragingly, it also achieved a prediction accuracy of 97.8% on an apple leaf disease dataset with a complex outdoor background. The experimental results show that compared with existing advanced plant disease diagnosis models, the proposed model has fewer parameters, higher recognition accuracy, and lower complexity.

As a result, early detection of plant disease is critical for increased agricultural productivity. Plant diseases are caused by both bacterial and fungal diseases and some factors such as temperature, pH, humidity, and moisture. Misdiagnosis can result in misuse of chemicals, environmental imbalance, and drug resistance. Traditional approaches needed a large amount of time, intensive research, and continual farm monitoring to identify plant health concerns. However, thanks to recent technical developments, companies have managed to identify the ideal solutions, leading to increased yields. In a range of industries, artificial intelligence (AI), which is a fast-expanding science, can be utilized to automate processes and boost productivity. In the agricultural sector, it was also employed to increase crop productivity through the early identification and categorization of disease affection. Image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, augmented features, and model prediction all contribute to automatic disease detection. Deep convolutional neural networks have now been utilized in recent years to accurately identify crop illnesses and classify them into the appropriate classifications. In this paper, we use a deep neural network approach to classify illnesses in 11 crop species using thousands of photos. As a result, two deep learning algorithms, namely, VGG16 and XceptionNet are applied to the Kaggle database to classify the diseases under study. The accuracy and loss are compared and then the findings are discussed for both the models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.","Convolution; Deep CNN; Early disease detection; VGG16; XceptionNet","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Farms; Image segmentation; Agricultural productivity; Bacterial disease; Computational comparisons; Deep CNN; Early disease detection; Fungal disease; Plant disease; VGG16; Xceptionnet; Yield loss; Crops","","","","","","","Khoje S., Bodhe S.K., Application of colour texture moments to detect external skin damages in guavas (Psidium guajava L), World Appl Sci J, 27, 5, pp. 590-596, (2013); Rehman T.U., Mahmud M.S., Chang Y.K., Jin J., Shin J., Current and future applications of statistical machine learning algorithms for agricultural machine vision systems, Comput Electron Agric, 156, pp. 585-605, (2019); Lu Y., Shujuan Z.N., Liu Y., Zhang Y., Identification of Rice Diseases Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, (2017); Omrani E., Khoshnevisan B., Shamshirband S., Shaboohi H., Anuar N.B., Nasir M.H.N.M., Potential of redial basis function-based support vector regression for apple disease detection, Meas, 55, (2014); Fulsoundar K., Kadlag T., Bhadale S., Bharvirkar P., Detection and classification of plant leaf diseases, Int J Eng Res Gen Sci, 2, 6, (2014); Preethi R., Priyanka S., Priyanka U., Sheela A., Efficient knowledge based system for leaf disease detection and classification, Int J Adv Res Sci Eng, 4, 1, (2015); Revathi P., Hema Latha M., Classification of cotton leaf spot diseases using image processing edge detection techniques, Int J Appl Res, pp. 169-173, (2012); Arivazhagan S., Newlin Shebiah R., Ananthi S., Vishnu Varthini S., Detection of unhealthy region of plant leaves and classification of plant leaf diseases using texture features, CIGR J, 15, 1, (2013); Phadikar S., Sil J., Rice disease identification using pattern recognition techniques, Proceedings of 11Th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology, pp. 25-27, (2008); Khairnar K., Dagade R., Disease detection and diagnosis on plant using image processinga review, Int J Comput Appl, 108, 13, (2014); Zhang L.N., Yang B., Research on recognition of maize disease based on mobile internet and support vector machine technique, Trans Tech Publ, 108, 13, (2014); Shicha Z., Hanping M., Bo H., Yancheng Z., Morphological feature extraction for cotton disease recognition by machine vision, Microcomput Inf, 23, 4, (2007); Fuentes A., Yoon S., Kim S.C., Park D.S., A robust deep-learning-based detector for real-time tomato plant diseases and pests detection, Sensors, 17, 9, (2017); Mohanty S.P., Hughes D., Salathe M., Using deep-learning for image base plant disease detection, Front Plant Sci, 7, (2016); Fuentes A., Yoon S., Kim S., Park D (2022) A robust deep-learning-based detector for real-time tomato plant diseases and pest’s recognition, Sensors, 17, 9, (2017); Tiwari V., Joshi R.C., Dutta M.K., Dense convolutional neural networks based multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images.

The advent of computer vision and image processing techniques has encouraged contribution in disease identification systems in plants. This paper proposes a fuzzy feature extraction technique and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) for the identification of grapevine diseases using leaf images. The color features are extracted using fuzzy color histogram. Then, the extracted features are fed to a PNN classifier for grapevine disease classification. The proposed technique achieves a maximum recognition accuracy of 95.54% on the test dataset. On comparing the proposed system with upcoming deep learning techniques, the former is found to be more efficient for small training data. © 2022 IEEE.","Fuzzy features; Leaf disease identification; PNN","Convolutional neural networks; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Image processing; Statistical tests; Fuzzy features; Image processing technique; Leaf disease; Leaf disease identification; Leaf images; Neural-networks; Probabilistic neural network; Probabilistics; Vision processing; Yield loss; Deep learning","","","","","","","Dangl J.L., Horvath D.M., Staskawicz B.J., Pivoting the plant immune system from dissection to deployment, Science, 341, 6147, pp. 746-751, (2013); Strange R.N., Scott P.R., Plant disease: a threat to global food security, Annu.

Because it is difficult to identify the characteristics of cassava disease, if not professional cassava growers, it will be prone to misjudgment. In order to strengthen the judgment of cassava diseases, the identification characteristics of cassava diseases such as different color of cassava leaf disease spots, abnormal leaf shape and disease spot area were studied. In this paper, deep convolutional neural network was used to classify cassava leaf diseases, and image classification technology was used to recognize and classify cassava leaf diseases. A lightweight module Multi-scale fusion model (MSFM) based on attention mechanism was proposed to extract disease features of cassava leaves to enhance the classification of disease features. The resulting feature map contained key disease identification information. The study used 22,000 cassava disease leaf images as a data set, including four different cassava leaf disease categories and healthy cassava leaves. The experimental results show that the cassava leaf disease classification model based on multi-scale fusion Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) improves EfficientNet compared with the original model, with the average recognition rate increased by nearly 4% and the average recognition rate up to 88.1%. It provides theoretical support and practical tools for the recognition and early diagnosis of plant disease leaves.

At present, tomato pests are detected mainly through manual collection and classification of field samples by professionals. This manual classification method is expensive and time-consuming. The existing automatic pest detection methods based on a computer require a simple background environment of the pests and cannot locate pests. To solve these problems, based on the idea of deep learning, a tomato pest identification algorithm based on an improved YOLOv4 fusing triplet attention mechanism (YOLOv4-TAM) was proposed, and the problem of imbalances in the number of positive and negative samples in the image was addressed by introducing a focal loss function. The K-means + + clustering algorithm is used to obtain a set of anchor boxes that correspond to the pest dataset. At the same time, a labeled dataset of tomato pests was established. The proposed algorithm was tested on the established dataset, and the average recognition accuracy reached 95.2%. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of tomato pests, which is superior to the previous methods. Algorithmic performance on practical images of healthy and unhealthy objects shows that the proposed method is feasible for the detection of tomato pests.

Weed plays a vital role in influencing crop productivity. The wastage and pollution of farmland's natural atmosphere instigated by full coverage chemical herbicide spraying are increased. Since the proper identification of weeds from crops helps to reduce the usage of herbicide and improve productivity, this study presents a novel computer vision and deep learning based weed detection and classification (CVDL-WDC) model for precision agriculture. The proposed CVDL-WDC technique intends to properly discriminate the plants as well as weeds. The proposed CVDL-WDC technique involves two processes namely multiscale Faster RCNN based object detection and optimal extreme learning machine (ELM) based weed classification. The parameters of the ELM model are optimally adjusted by the use of farmland fertility optimization (FFO) algorithm. A comprehensive simulation analysis of the CVDL-WDC technique against benchmark dataset reported the enhanced outcomes over its recent approaches interms of several measures. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

The G-ResNet50 is based on the ResNet50, and the focal loss function is introduced in G-ResNet50 to make the model devote itself to disease images that are difficult to classify. During the training process of the G-ResNet50 model, its convolutional layer and pooling layer inherit the pre-trained weight parameters from the ResNet50 model on the PlantVillage dataset, while adding dropout regularization and batch regularization methods to optimize the network model. The strawberry disease dataset includes four sample images of healthy plants, powdery mildew, strawberry anthracnose, and leaf spot disease. The dataset is enhanced and expanded by operations including angle rotation, adjusting contrast and brightness, and adding Gaussian noise. Compared with existing models such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2, the results of model training and testing on 7,525 four-category leaf datasets show that the G-ResNet50 model has faster convergence speed and better classification effect, and its average recognition accuracy rate reached 98.67%, which is significantly higher than other models. Through the three evaluation indicators of precision rate, recall rate, and confusion matrix, it is concluded that the G-ResNet50 has good robustness, high stability, and high recognition accuracy and can provide a feasible solution for strawberry disease detection in practical applications.  © 2022 Xu Wenchao and Yan Zhi.","","Classification (of information);

For prompt cures and efficient management of plant diseases, accurate diagnosis, close observation, and foresight are necessary. Methods like deep learning, feature extraction, and picture recognition are frequently used in disease detection. For farmers, agronomists, and decision-makers, machine learning can be used to distinguish, monitor, and forecast illness affecting plants. The Plant Village Data set is meticulously segmented for disease prediction training and testing; as a result, several plant species are acknowledged and given new names to make an accurate database. The classifier is then trained using training data, and the output will then be detected with the highest accuracy possible. Therefore, this study presented a CNN-based system for disease detection in plants and also evaluated the overall performance of various classifiers at the study's records set to decide which had the most accuracy. The performance and usability of machine learning models must be improved through ongoing research and development if we are to eventually see more effective and sustainable farming practices. The created model also maps the soil and crop database and recommends appropriate crops depending on the number of nutrients available in the soil, enabling farmers to choose the right crops to be sown in their fields. Therefore, it is important to identify crop diseases as soon as possible. Farmers will profit from using a quick, creative approach and a crop recommendation system.  © 2023 IEEE.","A profound understanding; Disease detection; diseased plants; Neural networks (NN); Neural networks with convolutions; Plant Village; Predictive Analytics; Training a machine","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Farms; Feature extraction; Food supply; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Rural areas; Statistical tests; A profound understanding; Disease detection; Diseased plant; Neural network; Neural network with convolution; Neural-networks; Plant disease; Plant village; Training a machine; Crops","","","","","","","Saxena L., Armstrong L., A survey of image processingtechniquesfor agriculture, Proceedings of Asian Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture, pp. 401-413, (2014); Stewart E.L., McDonald B.A., Measuring quantitative virulencein the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoriatritici using highthroughput automated image analysis, Phytopathology, 104, 9, pp. 985-992, (2014); Krizhevsky, Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., Image net classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2012); Hughes D.P., Salathe M., An open access repository of images on plant health to enable the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowd sourcing, (2015); Raza S., Prince G., Clarkson J.P., Rajpoot N.M., Automatic detection of diseased tomato plants using thermal and stereo visible light images, PLoS ONE, (2015); Hernandez-Rabadan D.L., Ramos-Quintana F., Guerrero Juk J., Integrating soms and a bayesian classifier for segmenting diseased plants in uncontrolled environments, the Scientific World Journal, (2014); Babu J., Self secured model for cloud based IOT systems, Measurement: Sensors, 24, (2022); Sushama, Global Identification Passport: A Unique Cloud based Passport Model, Proceedings-5th International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology, ICSSIT 2023, pp. 801-805, (2023); Sushama, Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the diagnosis of the virus in the human body, World Journal of Engineeringthis link is disabled, 19, 5, pp. 652-657, (2022); Sushama, Automated extraction of non-functional requirements from text files: A supervised learning approach, Handbook of Intelligent Computing and Optimization for Sustainable Development, pp. 149-170, (2022); Pandit H., Mangarulkar A., Dabade U., Development of New Prototype Interactive System for Casting Defect Identification and Analysis, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 197, pp. 3010-3010, (2012); Pandit H., WebCADAS: A New Online Education System for Casting Defect Identification, Analysis and Optimisation of Parameters, International Journal of Latest Trends in Engineering and Technology (IJLTET)., 5, 4, pp. 246-253, (2015); Desai P., Pandit H., Quality Improvement Tools for Casting Defects in Foundry, International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 13, 6, pp. 130-134, (2023); Pandit H., Jigs and Fixtures in Manufacturing, International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications, 12, pp. 50-55, (2022); Kareem M.A., Tatagar M.H., Kurubetta K.D., Mesta R., Masuthi D., Waseem M.A., Evaluation of bio-efficacy and phytotoxicity of pyraclostrobin 20% WG against anthracnose disease chilli, Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology, 10, 3, pp. 2397-2399, (2016); Kareem M.A., Tatagar M.H., Kurubetta K.D., Masuthi D., Ma W., Evaluation of bio-efficacy and phytotoxicity of chlorothalonil 75% WP against fruit rot of chilli, Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology, 10, 4, pp. 2909-2911, (2016); Almahirah Z., Salameh M., The Effect of Smart Blockchain Contracts on the Financial Services Industry in the Banking Sector in Jordan, Ilkogretim Online, 20, 5, (2021); Almahirah M.S.Z., The effectiveness of the strategic activities of production and operations management in achieving the total quality of products in the Jordanian Pharmaceutical Production Company, Journal of Positive School Psychology, pp. 2907-2916, (2022); Almahairah M.S., Artificial Intelligence Application for Effective Customer Relationship Management, 2023 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), pp. 1-7, (2023)","","Chaudhary N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences, ICTACS 2023","1 November 2023 through 3 November 2023","Tashkent","196891","","979-835034233-8","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Deep learning is being considered to be an important aspect of feature extraction and image classification through various computer vision tasks. In this paper, Resnet-32 model is well-Thought-out for the early recognition of rice plant diseases and data augmentation is proposed to improve classification accuracy. As well, a comparative study on various deep learning architectures is made. Deep learning model with small number of datasets is the major challenge that's result in over fitting. And for this data augmentation is contemplated to be the solution. Data augmentation plays a crucial role in improvising classification accuracy with its ability to grow the training samples in size. This happens by applying some kind of transformations to an input image. Resnet architecture is used for feature extrication. Thus, in our work, classification of augmented rice-leaf image data set is performed with Resnet model. A Resnet based model is used to train around 2215 rice leaves images obtained from plant village datasets. With seven data augmentation techniques being applied the number of images increased to 12684, which is used to identify different plant species and different disease categories. The trained model could achieve an accuracy of 99.55% on test dataset and a validation loss of 0.0029, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. The outcome of this findings shows that proposed approach achieved higher performance on the identification and early prevention of rice leaf diseases.  © 2022 IEEE.","Convolutional layer; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Disease detection; Residual network","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; Classification accuracy; Convolutional layer; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Disease detection; Leaf disease; Learning architectures; Plant disease; Residual network; Rice leaves; Network architecture","","","","","","","Barbedo J.G.A., An automatic method to detect and measure leaf disease symptoms using digital image processing, Plant Disease, 98, 12, pp. 1709-1716, (2014); Patil S.P., Zambre R.S., Classification of cotton leaf spot disease using support vector machine, International Journal of Engineering Research, 3, 4, pp. 1511-1514, (2014); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, (2014); Kawasaki Y., Uga H., Kagiwada S., Iyatomi H., December.

In many situation the agriculture production may be reduced, which consequently reduces the nation's economy, if the crops get affected due to diseases. Generally, diseases affect the leaves of the crops which should be identified in the early stage so that the quality and quantity of the produce may be increased. To detect the leaf diseases at an early stage and taking proper remedial actions will be more helpful for the farmers. So there is a need for an automatic system for leaf disease recognition that identifies and classifies the leaf diseases at an early stage. The highlights of the objective work focus on the DCNN models of leaf images used and overall performance according to the performance metrics that are been applied for plant disease identification. During the past decade many researchers are focusing on leaf disease recognition by proposing various methods and techniques using traditional image processing and machine learning techniques. This motivation of the proposed DCNN work is suited for increasing performance accuracy and minimizing response time in the identification of tomato leaf diseases. In this paper we have proposed an automatic system for leaf disease identification in tomato leaves using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) since, DCNN focuses on agriculture areas during recent years. In the proposed work we have used 18160 images of tomato leaf diseases which are collected from plant village data set. We have split the dataset that contains 60% of images from the dataset for training and 40% of images for testing. With our proposed DCNN model we have obtained 98.40% of accuracy for the testing set. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Convolution neural networks; Deep neural Network; Dynamic integrated system; Electrochemical pretreatment procedure; Energy optimization; Hybrid energy storage system; MLP and SVM; Recognition","agriculture; Article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; performance indicator; plant disease; plant leaf; sensitivity and specificity; tomato","","","","","K-Nearest; Nvidia","Funding text 1: The proposed work the images are analysed with two classifiers namely SVM and MLP and also we have compared with recent paper (Geetharamani and Pandian, 2019) for the evaluation of disease outcomes for tomato leaves. Fig. 6 shows the results of these analyses. The precision of tomato leaf disease recognition classifiers was assessed using error matrices. From these predicted data the multiple classifiers identifies the tomato leaf disease that are properly recognized most illnesses, Although the DCNN obviously performed better than comparison of two ML algorithms. Because of this apparent symptoms and ease of quantifying the disease, Early blight disease was best differentiated between the various diseases. Late blight, Early blight illness was the next most correctly classified illness, while all other illnesses were correctly categorized between 84% and 93%.Bacterial spot, septoria leaf spot, curl virus, leaf mold, mosaic virus is classified with the low precision even with the consistency of the pathological characteristics between the ten diseases.In their later stages, some symptoms of the diseases are too similar to be distinguished, such as early blight and late blight diseases, both of which show annulments in later stages. Furthermore, identifying the specific symptoms in the well before and intermediate stages of these diseases is difficult. In relation to the above instances, the symptoms of certain illnesses are also very comparable and most common precise prediction of plant diseases well in time helps to apply suitable prevention and protection measures in plants. Hence, it helps improve the yield quality and increase crop productivity. The traditional approach's limitations have motivated the researchers to propose technological solutions for disease prediction in plants. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes classifier, Random Forests, K-Nearest (KNN), etc. are used for developing automated disease detection models.So based on our experimental outcomes deep convolution neural networks helps us to visualize each filters based on the leaf diseases segments accurately. Based on the results and discussions, the authors conclude that DCNN is a better feature extractor than handcrafted feature engineering models. DCNN being an automatic feature extractor saves the efforts of researchers. Furthermore, these models are robust under challenging conditions, such as images with a complex background, non-uniform size, improper orientation, and images captured in poor illumination, etc. However, there are several challenges and issues of these approached, the requirement of a huge dataset, longer training time to yield the desired output.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank the management of Vellore Institute Technology, Vellore , India for funding the research labs where the research work was carried out.We would also like to thank NVIDIA Corporation for providing GPU grant in support of this research work.","Cheng, Matson E.T., A Feature-Based Machine Learning Agent for Automatic Rice and Weed Discrimination, International Conference on Artifcial Intelligence and Soft Computing, pp. 517-527, (2015); Dandawate Y., Kokare R., An automated approach for classification of plant diseases towards development of futuristic Decision Support System in Indian perspective, IEEE International conference on advances in computing, communications and Informatics, pp. 794-879, (2015); Es-Saady Y., Massi I.E., Yassa M.E., Mammass D., Benazoun A., Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on serial combination of two SVM classifiers, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Electrical and Information Technologies, Tangiers, Morocco, pp. 561-566, (2016); Fuentes A., Yoon S., Kim S.C., Park D.S., A robust deep-learning-based detector for real-time tomato plant diseases and pests recognition, Sensors, 17, (2017); Gavhale M.K.R., Gawande U., An overview of the research on plant leaves disease detection using image processing techniques, J.

In the medical plant sector, identifying plants is a difficult and time-consuming procedure that prevents correct appraisal of precious plant reserves like Cardiospermum halicacabum. Cardiospermum Halicacabum, also known as Ballon vine in English. The leaves are traditionally used in to treat colds, coughs, and malaria. They are renowned for having antioxidant qualities. The root is demulcent and diuretic. It is used to cure rheumatism and is mucilaginous but tastes nauseating. The root is prescribed for piles, rheumatism, nerve illnesses. Amenorrhea is treated using the leaves. The plant's floral parts are used to create a mother tincture for this use. Additionally, this is transformed into lotions and ointments. Researchers have explored various approaches to extract meaningful features from plant images and develop robust models capable of accurate classification and recognition. The results of this study can pave the way for further advancements in automated plant species detection and monitoring using drone technology and deep learning algorithms.

Convolutional neural network training requires a large amount of data, but traditional data enhancement methods (such as rotation, flipping, translation) are restricted by fixed rules and cannot generate images with diversity and variability. Aiming at the problem of the lack of soybean leaf disease data set, this study proposes a data enhancement method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for soybean leaf disease identification. The method is based on a cyclic adversarial network and its discriminator uses dense connections. Strategies to reduce the size and computational complexity of the final model. Using a cyclic adversarial network to convert between healthy and diseased leaves, unsupervised learning can be performed, using limited images to learn disease characteristics, there by generating highly recognizable soybean leaf images. Synthesis images generated from GANs and original images are fed together as the model training set input and the recognition model for recognizing 9 types of soybean leaf images is obtained. An accuracy rate of 95.89% can be achieved on the verification set. Experimental results show that the generative adversarial network provided in this article can: Generate soybean leaf disease image data with high discriminative features, increase the size of the data set and provide a feasible solution for soybean leaf disease image data enhancement; as A regularization strategy to reduce over-fitting problems and improve the performance of the recognition model. © 2022 Xiao Yu, Cong Chen, Qi Gong and Lina Lu.","Agricultural Pests and Diseases; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Generating Adversarial Networks","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Agricultural pest and disease; Agricultural pests; Convolutional neural network; Data enhancement; Data set; Deep learning; Generating adversarial network; Leaf disease; Leaf images; agricultural pest; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; classification algorithm; convolutional neural network; deep learning; image enhancement; learning algorithm; machine learning; nonhuman; plant leaf; pustule; soybean; Generative adversarial networks","","","","","Scientific Research Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2022MG047); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (18BTQ062); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Shandong University of Technology, SDUT, (420052); Shandong University of Technology, SDUT","This Project “Research on the interdisciplinary theory, method and application of plant phenotype data management” supported by Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2022MG047), the National Social Science Fund of China (18BTQ062), Scientific Research Foundation for Ph.D. of Shandong University of Technology (420052).","Basha S.

In the agriculture field, image processing acts as a primary part. Cucumber is an important vegetable and its production in Pakistan is higher as compared to the other vegetables because of its use in salads. However, the diseases of cucumber such as Angular leaf spot, Anthracnose, blight, Downy mildew, and powdery mildew widely decrease the quality and quantity. Lately, numerous methods have been proposed for the identification and classification of diseases. Early detection and then treatment of the diseases in plants is important to prevent the crop from a disastrous decrease in yields. Many classification techniques have been proposed but still, they are facing some challenges such as noise, redundant features, and extraction of relevant features. In this work, an automated framework is proposed using deep learning and best feature selection for cucumber leaf diseases classification. In the proposed framework, initially, an augmentation technique is applied to the original images by creating more training data from existing samples and handling the problem of the imbalanced dataset. Then two different phases are utilized. In the first phase, fine-tuned four pre-trained models and select the best of them based on the accuracy. Features are extracted from the selected fine-tuned model and refined through the Entropy-ELM technique. In the second phase, fused the features of all four fine-tuned models and apply the Entropy-ELM technique, and finally fused with phase 1 selected feature. Finally, the fused features are recognized using machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process is conducted on five different datasets. On these datasets, the best-achieved accuracy is 98.4%. The proposed framework is evaluated on each step and also compared with some recent techniques. The comparison with some recent techniques showed that the proposed method obtained an improved performance. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, wheat leaf diseases have a major impact on growth. An accurate diagnosis of wheat leaf diseases is essential for wheat quality and the agricultural economy. To improve the identification precision of wheat leaf diseases, we propose an integrated deep learning algorithm, which combines a residual channel attention block (RCAB), a feedback block (FB), elliptic metric learning (EML), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) and call it RFE-CNN. First, we utilized two parallel CNNs to extract the basic features of healthy and diseased wheat leaves, respectively. Second, we used residual channel attention blocks to optimize the basic features. Third, we used feedback blocks to train the previous features. Finally, we sent these features into a CNN and elliptic metric learning for processing and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to VGG-19, ZFNet, GoogLeNet, Inception-V4, and Efficient-B7 in some aspects, such as shorter time consumption, higher recognition precision, and stronger adaptive ability. The overall classification accuracy was 98.83%, and the maximum testing accuracy was 99.95%. We obtained an average accuracy score of 99.50% on the open-source databases viz., CGIAR, Plant Diseases, LWDCD 2020, and Plant Pathology. The proposed method has a good reference for the promotion of intelligent crop disease and insect pest detection. The recognition rate is relatively low for the samples of different ecological locations and wheat varieties. Therefore, our algorithms need to be further improved to achieve a better balance. We will use hyperspectral imaging technology to obtain more spectral data on wheat leaf diseases and send them into deep learning models for classification research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Deep learning; Elliptic metric learning; Wheat leaf","","","","","","","","Shafi U., Mumtaz R., Shafaq Z., Zaidi S.M.H., Kaifi M.O., Mahmood Z., Zaidi S.A.R., Wheat rust disease detection techniques: a technical perspective, J.

The traditional method of manually identifying wheat yellow rust is very inefficient. To improve this situa-tion, this study proposed a deep-learning-based method for identifying wheat yellow rust from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The method was based on the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) semantic segmentation model to classify healthy wheat, yellow rust wheat, and bare soil in small-scale UAV images, and to investigate the spatial generalization of the model. In addition, it was proposed to use the high-accuracy classification results of traditional algorithms as weak samples for wheat yellow rust identification. The recognition accuracy of the PSPNet model in this study reached 98%. On this basis, this study used the trained semantic segmentation model to rec-ognize another wheat field. The results showed that the method had certain generalization ability, and its accuracy reached 98%. In addition, the high-accuracy classification result of a support vector machine was used as a weak label by weak supervision, which better solved the labeling problem of large-size images, and the final recognition accuracy reached 94%. Therefore, the present study method facilitated timely control measures to reduce economic losses. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the automated identification of pre-crop diseases is very important for farmers to increase production and income. In this paper, a tomato leaf disease identification method based on the optimized MobileNetV2 model is proposed. A dataset of 20,400 tomato disease images was created based on tomato disease images taken from the greenhouse and obtained from the PlantVillage database. The optimized MobileNetV2 model was trained with the dataset to obtain a classification model for tomato leaf diseases. The average recognition accuracy of the model is 98.3% and the recall rate is 94.9%, which is 1.2% and 3.9% higher than the original model, respectively, after experimental validation. The average prediction speed of the model for a single image is about 76 ms, which is 2.94% better than the original model. To verify the performance of the optimized MobileNetV2 model, it was compared with the Xception, Inception, and VGG16 feature extraction network models using migration learning, respectively. The experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the model is 0.4 to 2.4 percentage points higher than that of the Xception, Inception, and VGG16 models. It can provide technical support for the identification of tomato diseases, and is also important for plant growth monitoring under precision agriculture. © 2022,INMATEH - Agricultural Engineering.All Rights Reserved.","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Foliar disease identification; Mobile applications; Tomato","Classification (of information); Crops; Fruits; Crop disease; Deep learning; Foliar disease; Foliar disease identification; Leaf disease; Mobile applications; Recognition accuracy; Tomato; Tomato disease; Tomato leaf; Deep learning","","","","","Shandong Province Key R&D Program, (2019GNC106144)","This research was jointly supported by the Shandong Province Key R&D Program(2019GNC106144)","Bi C., Wang J., Duan Y., Fu B., Kang J., Shi Y., MobileNet Based Apple Leaf Diseases Identification, Mob.

In order to achieve better results in the classification of the severity (healthy, general or severe) of crop diseases, a CDCNNv2 algorithm based on residual network (ResNet 50) and deep transfer learning was proposed. By training more than 30, 000 crop disease images which were divided into 10 species, a model for the classification of disease severity was obtained, and the recognition accuracy could reach 91.51%. For verifying the robustness of the CDCNNv2 model, comparative experiments were carried out with ResNet 50, Xception, VGG16, VGG19 and DenseNet 121 that used transfer learning. The experimental results showed that the average accuracy of the CDCNNv2 model was increased by 2.78~10.93 percentage points, which had higher classification accuracy and strengthened the robustness of crop disease severity identification. At the same time, based on the model trained by this algorithm, combined with Android technology, a real-time and online crop diseases severity recognition APP was developed.

Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) are one of the main plant pests and cause over 100 million US dollars of agricultural loss worldwide every year. In general, identifying species of nematodes from their morphological characters is the first step for a nematologist. However, limited professionals cannot fulfill the huge demand. A fast identification system for nematodes applying imaging classification methods would be a potential solution to amend the practical needs. In recent years, the rise of deep learning brought a significant breakthrough in object detection. In this study, deep learning algorithms were applied to develop the plant-parasitic nematode (PPN) image identification system. The experimental dataset included four genera (e.g., Aphelenchoides, Bursaphelenchus, Meloidogyne, and Pratylenchus) and 10 species of common PPNs worldwide. In addition, one free-living nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans, and two entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterocephalobellus sp. and Metarhabditis amsactae, were also collected as the control group for the recognition of the non-plant-parasitic nematodes. In total, 9483 images of nematode images were acquired. Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster RCNN) architecture was selected to develop the PPN identification model. As a result, the model with the ResNet-101 structure achieved the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 0.9018. © American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting, ASABE 2021.

This article presents a potato disease classification algorithm that leverages these distinct appearances and advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning. The algorithm uses a deep convolutional neural network, training it to classify the tubers into five classes: namely, four disease classes and a healthy potato class. The database of images used in this study, containing potato tubers of different cultivars, sizes, and diseases, was acquired, classified, and labeled manually by experts. The models were trained over different train-test splits to better understand the amount of image data needed to apply deep learning for such classification tasks. The models were tested over a data set of images taken using standard low-cost RGB (red, green, and blue) sensors and were tagged by experts, demonstrating high classification accuracy. This is the first article to report the successful implementation of deep convolutional networks, popular in object identification, to the task of disease identification in potato tubers, showing the potential of deep learning techniques in agricultural tasks. © 2019 The American Phytopathological Society","Colletotrichum coccodes; Helminthosporium solani; Image recognition; Rhizoctonia solani; Solanum tuberosum; Streptomyces spp; Tuber blemish diseases","Deep Learning; Neural Networks (Computer); Plant Diseases; Plant Tubers; Solanum tuberosum; artificial neural network; growth, development and aging; microbiology; plant disease; plant tuber; potato","","","","","Cognitive Robotics Initiative; Leona M. and Harry B.

In agriculture sectors, it is the greatest challenge to identify plant diseases. The state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) gives excellent results to solve image classification tasks in computer vision. Transfer Learning enables us to develop a deep CNN network in a most cost effective way. In this work, a Transfer Learning based CNN model was developed for the identification of plant diseases precisely. The dataset, we have used is consists of 70295 training images and 17572 validation images holding 38 different classes of plant leaves images. We have focused mainly on ResNet50 network, a popular CNN architecture as our pre-trained model in Transfer Learning. Additionally, several Transfer Learning architectures were experimented with few other popular pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, AlexNet) and compared with the proposed model.

Plant diseases are one of the underlying causes in the decrease in the number of quantity and quality of the farming crops.Recognition of diseases fromthe plant images is an active research topicwhich makes use of machine learning (ML) approaches.Anovel deep neural network (DNN) classification model is proposed for the identification of paddy leaf disease using plant image data. Classification errors were minimized by optimizing weights and biases in the DNN model using a crow search algorithm (CSA) during both the standard pre-training and fine-tuning processes. This DNN-CSA architecture enables the use of simplistic statistical learning techniques with a decreased computational workload, ensuring high classification accuracy. Paddy leaf images were first preprocessed, and the areas indicative of disease were initially extracted using a k-means clustering method. Thresholding was then applied to eliminate regions not indicative of disease. Next, a set of features were extracted from the previously isolated diseased regions. Finally, the classification accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DNN-CSA model were verified experimentally and shown to be superior to a support vector machine with multiple cross-fold validations. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

[Method]In this paper, a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) was designed for plant leaf image segmentation. First, a log-logic function as objective function replaces the complex Softmax function, which transforms the segmentation task into a binary classification problem suitable for plant leaf segmentation. Second, the batch normalization (BN) technology was introduced into the FCNN,which improved the convergence of the whole FCNN. Finally, due to the lack of evaluation index in the research of plant leaf segmentation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as a new evaluation protocol, was designed. It reflected the changes between recall rate and false alarm rate of plant leaf segmentation under different threshold settings. [Result]The method reduced the complexity of parameters and improved the convergence performance of FCNN. Experimental results showed that this method was more complete to segment the leaf image than the color-based method in Leafsnap. The proposed ROC curve adequately evaluated the performance of plant leaf segmentation. [Conclusion] Compared with traditional plant leaf segmentation methods, the proposed method based on deep learning realizes input image by end to end processing, and does not require pre-processing like image conversion, noise filter and morphological operations, etc. Therefore, this method can be used for leaf segmentation. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

While, in actual agricultural market, maize seeds always should be covered by seed coating agents to resist diseases invasion and pests, improve germination rate, and increase yield. The kinds of seed coating are many and varied, and it is hard to determine their components. Therefore it is usually necessary to build identification model by maize seeds without seed coating, and then use the model to recognize seeds with seed coating. The maize seeds coating usually mixed by insecticides, fungicides, fertilizer, plant growth regulators, etc. These components often include hydrogen group organic compounds, which have certain absorption to near infrared spectrum. So the seed coating agent has an interference on near infrared spectroscopy qualitative identification effect. It will reduce the performance of conventional machine learning methods significantly. To reduce the influence caused by seed coating, a method of near infrared spectroscopy qualitative modeling based on deep learning method has been proposed in this paper. Firstly, maize seed spectrum without seed coating agent were used as training set, then a qualitative analysis model is constructed by stack auto encoder algorithm and Softmax classifier. With this deep learning model, maize seeds with seed coating can be identified. The experimental results indicated with the method based on deep learning, maize varietal authenticity recognition rate reduction caused by seed coating is controlled within 3%. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Maize; Single coated seed; varietal authenticity identification","Absorption spectroscopy; Authentication; Classification (of information); Coatings; Industrial electronics; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Plant life extension; Seed; Agricultural markets; Authenticity identifications; Conventional machines; Maize; Near infrared spectra; Plant growth regulators; Qualitative analysis model; Qualitative identification; Deep learning","","","","","Shengli College , China University of Petroleum Science and Technology, (KY2017006ˈKY2015011); National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Projects of China, (2014YQ470377); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (15CX02103A)","V.

In severe cases, plant diseases may even lead to no grain harvest completely. Therefore, seeking fast, automatic, less expensive and accurate methods to detect plant diseases is of great realistic significance. In this paper, we studied the transfer learning for the deep CNNs and modified the network structure to enhance the learning ability of the tiny lesion symptoms. The pre-trained MobileNet-V2 was extended with the classification activation map (CAM), which was used for visualization as well as plant lesion positioning, and both were selected in our approach. Particularly, the transfer learning was performed twice in model training: the first phase only inferred the weights from scratch for new extended layers while the bottom convolution layers were frozen with the parameters trained from ImageNet; the second phase retrained the weights using the target dataset by loading the model trained in the first phase. Then, the yielded optimum model was used for identifying plant diseases. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. It achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.85% on the public dataset. Even under multiple classes and complex background conditions, the average accuracy reaches 99.11% on the collected plant disease images. Thus, the proposed approach efficiently accomplished plant disease identification and presented a superior performance relative to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Plant disease identification; Transfer learning","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Food products plants; Transfer learning; Complex background; Learning abilities; Model training; Multiple class; Network structures; Public dataset; Recognition accuracy; State-of-the-art methods; Deep learning","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61672439); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (20720181004)","This work is partly supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project no. 61672439) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (#20720181004).

Therefore, deep neural networks are applied to plant disease identification. To improve the feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks, the Parameter Exponential Nonlinear Activation Unit (PENLU) is proposed to replace the activated function of the neural network. This function not only adds multiple parameters but also brings better generalization ability to the neural network. In addition, the proposed function parameters can be updated by the inverse Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which has unparalleled advantages over the existing activated functions. The Residual Network (ResNet), improved by PENLU, is applied to navel orange lesion recognition and achieves the most advanced accuracy compared with traditional lesion recognition methods.

In recent years, with the great success of deep learning technology in the field of image classification and image recognition, and with the convenient acquisition of crop leaf images, it is possible to automatically identify crop disease through deep learning based on plant leaf disease images. This paper mainly completed the research and analysis of leaf disease identification of agricultural plants based on Inception-V3 neural network model transfer learning and fine-tuning. A large number of model accuracy tests are carried out by training neural networks with different parameters. When the network parameter Batch is set to 100 and the learning rate is set to 0.01, the training precision and test precision of the network reach the maximum. Its training precision rate for crop disease image recognition in the PlantVillage DataSet is 95.8%, and the precision rate on the test set is as high as 93%, and far exceeding the accuracy of manual recognition.

However, the misdiagnosis reduces production efficiency. With the development of computer technology, the use of deep learning and image recognition technology for plant disease detection has become an important research direction. We propose a convolutional neural network based on data augmentation combined with transfer learning to identify corn leaf disease models. The algorithm first increases the data by means of data augmentation to improve the generalization and accuracy of the model, and builds a convolutional neural network model based on transfer learning. Then, it uses the model for training, accelerates the training process of the convolutional neural network, and uses test dataset feedback network training results. In this study, the corn leaf images in PlantVillage were used as the dataset of our experiment to classify the four categories which consists of Corn Gray leaf spot, Corn Common rust, Corn Northern Leaf Blight and healthy leaves. We first obtained our optimization model by fine-tuning the GoogLeNet pre-training network, adjusting parameters such as optimizer and learning rate. Then we trained the optimization model, like the original GoogLeNet network, ResNet18, Vgg16, and Vgg19 networks based on transfer learning and compare the results. The results show that by using our optimized model, the average recognition accuracy of corn disease which consists of corn common leaf rust, Corn Common rust, Corn Northern Leaf Blight and healthy leaves reached 97.6%, and the recognition accuracy of each category was greater than 95%. Compared with the original GoogLeNet model, the highest accuracy rate is improved by 5.9%. Also, the effect is better when compared with other networks based on transfer learning.

The most common clues provided by the plants affected by fungal diseases are defaming of the plant color. In literature, several traditional rule-based algorithms and normal image processing techniques are used to identify the fungal plant diseases. However, the traditional approach suffers from poor disease identification accuracy. Convoluted neural network (CNN) is one of the potential deep learning neural networks used for image recognition and classification in plant pathology. In this chapter, some of the potential CNN architectures used for plant disease detection like LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and ZFnet are discussed with the architecture and advantages. The efficiencies achieved by ResNet and ZFNet are found to be good in terms of accuracy and error rate. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Al-Qizwini M., Barjasteh I., Al-Qassab H., Radha H., Deep learning algorithm for autonomous driving using googlenet, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pp. 89-96, (2017); Alom M.Z., Taha T.M., Yakopcic C., Westberg S., Sidike P., Nasrin M.S., Asari V.K., The history began from alexnet: A comprehensive survey on deep learning approaches, (2018); Alom M.Z., Taha T.M., Yakopcic C., Westberg S., Sidike P., Nasrin M.S., Asari V.K., The history began from alexnet: A comprehensive survey on deep learning approaches, (2018); Antioquia A.M.C., Tan D.S., Azcarraga A., Cheng W.H., Hua K.L., ZipNet: ZFNet-level Accuracy with 48x Fewer Parameters, IEEE Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP), pp. 1-4, (2018); Ballester P., Araujo R.M., On the performance of GoogLeNet and AlexNet applied to sketches, Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2016); Barbedo J.G.A., Koenigkan L.V., Santos T.T., Identifying multiple plant diseases using digital image processing, Biosystems Engineering, 147, pp. 104-116, (2016); Bouti A., Mahraz M.A., Riffi J., Tairi H., A robust system for road sign detection and classification using LeNet architecture based on convolutional neural network, Soft Computing, pp. 1-13, (2019); El-Sawy A., Hazem E.B., Loey M., CNN for handwritten arabic digits recognition based on LeNet-5, International conference on advanced intelligent systems and informatics, pp. 566-575, (2016); Fu L., Feng Y., Majeed Y., Zhang X., Zhang J., Karkee M., Zhang Q., Kiwifruit detection in field images using Faster R-CNN with ZFNet, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 51, 17, pp. 45-50, (2018); Iandola F.N., Han S., Moskewicz M.W., Ashraf K., Dally W.J., Keutzer K., SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and< 0.5 MB model size, (2016); Khirade S.D., Patil A.B., Plant disease detection using image processing, International conference on computing communication control and automation, pp. 768-771, (2015); Kim M.K., Contactless Palmprint Identification Using the Pretrained VGGNet Model, Journal of Korea Multimedia Society, 21, 12, pp. 1439-1447, (2018); Larkin R.P., Fravel D.R., Efficacy of various fungal and bacterial biocontrol organisms for control of Fusarium wilt of tomato, Plant Disease, 82, 9, pp. 1022-1028, (1998); Miles R., Mikolajczyk K., Compression of convolutional neural networks for high performance imagematching tasks on mobile devices, (2020); O'Shea K., Nash R., An introduction to convolutional neural networks, (2015); Petrellis N., A smart phone image processing application for plant disease diagnosis, International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST), pp. 1-4, (2017); Singla A., Yuan L., Ebrahimi T., Food/non-food image classification and food categorization using pre-trained googlenet model, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multimedia Assisted Dietary Management, pp. 3-11, (2016); Szegedy C., Ioffe S., Vanhoucke V., Alemi A.A., Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on learning, Thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, (2017); Targ S., Almeida D., Lyman K., Resnet in resnet: Generalizing residual architectures, (2016); Wang L., Guo S., Huang W., Qiao Y., Places205-vggnet models for scene recognition, (2015); Wu J., Introduction to convolutional neural networks, (2017); Xavier L.J., Boyetchko S.M., Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in plant disease control, Fungal biotechnology in agricultural, food, and environmental applications, pp. 183-194, (2004)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","978-179981724-6; 978-179981722-2","","","English","Artif.

Currently, the Trás-os-Montes region (Northeast of Portugal) concentrates the highest chestnuts production in Portugal, representing the major source of income in the region (€50M-€60M). The recognition of the quality of the Portuguese chestnut varieties has increasing the international demand for both industry and consumer-grade segments. As result, chestnut cultivation intensification has been witnessed, in such a way that widely disseminated monoculture practices are currently increasing environmental disaster risks. Depending on the dynamics of the location of interest, monocultures may lead to desertification and soil degradation even if it encompasses multiple causes and a whole range of consequences or impacts. In Trás-os-Montes, despite the strong increase in the cultivation area, phytosanitary problems, such as the chestnut ink disease (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), along with other threats, e.g. chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) and nutritional deficiencies, are responsible for a significant decline of chestnut trees, with a real impact on production. The intensification of inappropriate agricultural practices also favours the onset of phytosanitary problems. Moreover, chestnut trees management and monitoring generally rely on in-field time-consuming and laborious observation campaigns. To mitigate the associated risks, it is crucial to establish an effective management and monitoring process to ensure crop cultivation sustainability, preventing at the same time risks of desertification and land degradation. Therefore, this study presents an automatic method that allows to perform chestnut clusters identification, a key-enabling task towards the achievement of important goals such as production estimation and multi-temporal crop evaluation. The proposed methodology consists in the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and segment the chestnut fruits, considering a small dataset acquired based on digital terrestrial camera. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Chestnut; Chestnut Detection; Chestnut Tree; CNN; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; DL; Rough Segmentation; Tiling Segmentation; Xception","Classification (of information); Climatology; Convolution; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Forestry; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Chestnut; Chestnut Tree; Convolutional neural network; Rough segmentation; Xception; Fruits","","","","","Portuguese Science Foundation, (SFRH/BD/139702/2018); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","The authors would like to acknowledge project “CHIC – Cooperative Holistic View on Internet and Content” (N° 24498), financed the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through COMPETE2020 - the Operational Programme for Competitiveness.

In turn, scab diseases caused by ascomycetous fungi Venturiainaequalis and V. pyrina, are economically the most important diseases worldwide. Durable plant resistance has been widely regarded as the preferred disease limitation method due to environmental and food safety concerns. Whereas in cases where the use of pesticides cannot be avoided, their applications should be more precise, more targeted and reduced substantially. One way how to realize it is the smart and precision horticulture that can greatly increase the effectiveness of pesticides and use them more selectively. The smart and precision horticulture relies heavily on new technologies and digitalization, including sensing technologies, software applications, communication systems, telematics and positioning technologies, hardware and software systems, data analytics solutions, as well as knowledge linking biological information to data technologies. The aim of our project - development and implementation of mobile application with deep learning system for early identification and evaluation of apple and pear scab. The specific of project - the image processing must be completed by a mobile device without image upload into GPU cluster. This research presents the comparison of deep learning architectures developed for mobile devices (MobileNet and MobileNetV2). The classification precision and speed of neural networks are compared using open dataset”Fruits-360”. The results are applicable to develop transfer learning and domain adaptation solutions. Meanwhile, decomposition into many simple subtasks can reduce required device resources to complete complex analysis using mobiles, as well as to create trustworthy AI model. The model of MobileNetV2 showed the best results: total accuracy 0.998, Cohen's Kappa 0.991 and latency 212ms/step. © 2020 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

At the same time, many problems have also appeared in the diet, which has led to an increase in the incidence of diseases. Chinese herbal medicine has been widely used in the treatment of many diseases. But it is a problem for the collection and classification of Chinese herbal medicines. There are a wide variety of Chinese herbal medicine plants, and there are also some Chinese herbal medicine plants that look very similar. Even a taxonomist can hardly distinguish every herbal medicine, let alone for beginners. So we designs a method to automatically identify and classify Chinese herbal medicines by processing images and deep learning method, which can greatly reduce the workload, and improve the efficiency of work. The technology of Chinese herbal medicine recognition and identification based on image processing and deep learning method can effectively overcome the shortcomings of manual recognition that require rich experience. At present, deep learning is more and more popular, especially for image classification, so we use GoogLeNet to classify 50 kinds of Chinese herbal medicine by their images under natural conditions with complex backgrounds. And the method achieved good performance.

In this research field, there have been so many efforts focused on deep learning, namely deep CNN. The CNN is powerful and essential for image processing; however, do we really need deep CNN for plant diseases identification, cannot the shallow CNN extract enough information? We proposed two methods namely SCNN-KSVM (Shallow CNN with Kernel SVM) and SCNN-RF (Shallow CNN with Random Forest) to solve this confusion. The comparison experiments with other deep learning models were carried out on three different datasets. The results show that the SCNN-KSVM and SCNN-RF outperform other pretrained deep models on the indicators of precision, recall, and F1-score, with fewer parameters. The combination of shallow CNN and classic machine learning classification algorithm is a positive attempt to deal with the plant diseases identification in a simple manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Deep Learning; Recognition; Shallow","Agricultural robots; Decision making; Decision trees; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Agricultural yields; F1 scores; Learning models; Machine learning classification; Plant disease; Research fields; Timely identification; algorithm; artificial neural network; decision making; identification method; image processing; Deep learning","","","","","Natural Science Program of Shihezi University, (KX01230101); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31860333)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31860333 ) and the Natural Science Program of Shihezi University ( KX01230101 ).","Sethy P.K., Barpanda N.K., Rath A.K., Et al., Deep feature based rice leaf disease identification using support vector machine, Comput.

However, the crop yield is greatly affected by various plant diseases. Timely and accurate identification of leaf disease is very necessary for plant disease control. In this study, 38 types of leaf images (from 14 different crops) were used for the identification. These images were collected from the PlantVillage project (an open-source leaf disease database). Since the convolutional neural network (CNN) can automatically learn appropriate features from training data, CNN has become one of the most popular ways for image identification, better than traditional machine learning using manual feature extraction. However, the number of parameters in a CNN model was very huge, leading to a very heavy computation load. Thus, the traditional CNN was difficult to apply in real time measurement. Three methods were proposed to reduce the size of a CNN model and the computation load. The first method was to replace some of the 3×3 convolution filters with 1×1 convolution filters. A 3×3 convolution filter included 9 parameters, requiring 9 floating-point multiplications to obtain one solution. If this 3×3 convolution filter was replaced by a 1×1 convolution filter, the number of parameters and the number of required multiplications could reduce to 1. Thus, this method could help to reduce the size of a model and its computation load. The second method was to move the convolution calculation from large- to small-size feature maps. The idea was to reduce the computation load at the cost of a slightly performance drop. This can be done by adjusting the position of convolution module in the CNN. If a 3×3 filter was convolute with an 2N×2N feature map, the total number of floating-point multiplication was 36N2. If the same 3×3 filter was convolute with a N×N feature map, the total number of floating-point multiplication was 9N2, only a quarter of previous computation load. Therefore, if the convolution was performed with a smaller size feature map, the amount of calculation greatly reduced. The premise of this modification was that the performance drop was very small. The third method was to reduce the depth of a CNN model. It was obvious that a very deep neural network was not needed for a relatively simple task. Therefore, the idea behind the third method was to use a suitable network instead of a very complicated neural network for a relatively simple task. The experiment showed that the performance drop in the SqueezeNet was only around 0.5% for a classification task in the 38 types of images, if the last 3 fire modules were removed. 5 improved CNN models were proposed for leaf disease identification. The experiments showed that the size of the optimal model was around 0.62MB, and the computation load of this model was only 111 MFLOPs. Specifically, the average accuracy rate was 98.13%, and the average recall rate was 98.09%, while the average precision rate was 97.62%, showing higher cost efficiency than before. The proposed model can greatly reduce the size of the model, while reducing the computation load, and only a slight decrease in performance. There was an excellent balance on the performance, model size, and computation load. The improved model can be suitable for deployment on mobile terminals and other embedded resource-constrained devices, thereby contribute to real-time and accurate identification of crop diseases. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The most critical step in mitigating this problem is the correct and appropriate timely identification of the disease. The first step in identification of a disease is visual inspection. The massive scale of this problem and lack of professionals create a need for a automated accurate visual inspection technique. Recent advances in the field of computer vision, primarily through techniques such as use of convolutional neural networks and deep learning have generated impressive results in the field of image classification and object recognition. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting plant diseases using images of leaves using different state-of-the-art approaches. We use the Plant Village dataset comprising of 86,198 images of 25 crops across 57 classes (healthy and specific diseases). The images are of high quality and have been taken manually under appropriate lighting conditions. On this dataset, our model is able to attain a significantly high average accuracy of 99.374% using transfer learning on state-of-the-art models trained on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset having 1.2 million images across 1000 classes. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning; Neural networks; Plant diseases; Residual learning; Transfer learning","Computation theory; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Object recognition; Plants (botany); Critical steps; Food security; Lighting conditions; Plant disease; Residual learning; State-of-the-art approach; Timely identification; Visual inspection; Transfer learning","","","","","","","Strange R., Scott P.R., Plant disease: A threat to global food security, Phytopathology, 43, (2005); Tatem A.J., Rogers D.J., Hay S.I., Global transport networks and infectious disease spread, Adv.

In this study, we have collected more than 45 papers published during the year 2017-2020 from the peer-reviewed journals of different databases such as Scopus and Web of Science analogous to the keywords such as plant disease identification, recognition, and classification using ML and DL algorithms. An organized way of analysis of various plant disease classification models has been shown in well-formed tables. In this paper, we have conducted a systematic literature study on the applications of the state-of-the-art ML and DL algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), other few popular ML algorithms and AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, and other few popular DL algorithms respectively for plant disease categorization. Each stated algorithm is characterized through the corresponding processing methods such as image segmentation, feature extraction, along with the standardized experimental-setup metrics such as total number of training/testing dataset employed, number of diseases under considerations, type of classifier utilized, and the percentage of classification accuracy. This work will be a beneficial resource for researchers to recognize any particular type of plant diseases through data-driven approaches. The development of mobile-based applications using the studied ML/DL approaches will surely increase agricultural productivity. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Classification; Plant Disease Detection","Agricultural robots; Cellular radio systems; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Nearest neighbor search; Productivity; Wireless networks; Agricultural productivity; Analysis of various; Classification accuracy; Classification system; Data-driven approach; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning approaches; Neural network (nn); Support vector machines","","","","","","","Nagaraju M., Priyanka C., Systematic review of deep learning techniques in plant disease detection, International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management., 11, 3, pp. 547-560, (2020); Kaur S., Shreelekha P., Shivani G., Plants disease identification and classification through leaf images: A survey, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering., 26, 2, pp. 507-530, (2019); Rehman T.U., Md Sultan M., Young Chang K., Jian J., Shin J., Current and future applications of statistical machine learning algorithms for agricultural machine vision systems, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture., 156, pp. 585-605, (2019); Muhammad H.S., Johan P., Khalid M.A., Plant disease detection and classification by deep learning, Plants., 8, 468, pp. 1-22, (2019); Kamilaris A., Francesc X., Prenafeta-Boldu, Deep learning in agriculture: A survey, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture., 147, pp. 70-90, (2018); Dhingra G., Kumar V., Joshi H.D., Study of digital image processing techniques for leaf disease detection and classification, Multimedia Tools and Applications., 77, 15, (2018); Singh K., Kumar S., Kaur P., Support vector machine classifier based detection of fungal rust disease in pea plant (pisamsativam), International Journal of Information Technology., (2018); Singh V., Misra A.K., Detection of plant leaf diseases using image segmentation and soft computing techniques, Information Processing Agriculture., 4, 1, pp. 41-49, (2017); Kaur S., Pandey S., Goel S., Semi-automatic leaf disease detection and classification system for soybean culture, IET Image Processing., 12, 6, pp. 1038-1048, (2018); Kaur P., Pannu H.S., Malhi A.K., Plant disease recognition using fractional-order zernike moments and SVM classifier, Neural Computing and Application., (2019); Islam M., Dinh A., Wahid K., Bhowmik P., Detection of potato diseases using image segmentation and multiclass support vector machine, Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE), 2017 IEEE 30th Canadian Conference On.

Pests and diseases remain a major threat and a large fraction of crops are lost each year due to them. Automated detection of crop health from images helps in taking timely actions to increase yield while helping reduce input cost. With an aim to detect crop diseases and pests with high confidence, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and boosting techniques on Corn leaf images in different health states. The queen of cereals, Corn, is a versatile crop that has adapted to various climatic conditions. It is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice. Considering that different diseases might have different treatments, incorrect detection can lead to incorrect remedial measures. Although CNN based models have been used for classification tasks, we aim to classify similar looking disease manifestations with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by existing deep learning methods. We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features, with a classifier and boosting in order to achieve plant disease classification. Using an ensemble of Adaptive Boosting cascaded with a decision tree based classifier trained on features from CNN, we have achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying the Corn leaf images into four different categories viz. Healthy, Common Rust, Late Blight and Leaf Spot. This is about 8% improvement in classification performance when compared to CNN only.

However, these approaches are generally based on learned classification models with target classes of joint host species-disease pairs that may not allow optimal use of the available information. This is because these approaches require distinguishing between similar host species or diseases, and more importantly, they have limited scalability due to the size of a network gradually increases as new classes are added, despite the fact that information on host species or diseases is already available. This constraint is all the more important as it can be difficult to collect/establish a specific list of all diseases for each host plant species in an actual application. In this paper, we address the problems by proposing a new conditional multi-task learning (CMTL) approach which allows the distribution of host species and disease characteristics learned simultaneously with a conditional link between them. This conditioning is formed in such a way that the knowledge to infer the prediction of one concept (the diseases) depends on the other concept (the host species), which corresponds to the way plant pathologists used to infer the diseases of the host species. We show that our approach can improve the performance of plant disease identification compared to the usual species-disease pair modeling in the previous studies. Meanwhile, we also compose a new dataset on plant disease identification that could serve as an important benchmark in this field. © 2020 IEEE","Multi-task learning; Plant disease identification","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Host plants; Plant disease; Target class; Multi-task learning","","","","","Agropolis Fon-dation, (1604-019, ANR-10-LABX-0001-01); Agropolis Fondation, AF; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-16-CONV-0004)","Funding text 1: This research project was supported by Agropolis Fon-dation, Numev, Cemeb, #DigitAG, under the reference ID 1604-019 through the ”Investissements d’avenir” programme (Labex Agro:ANR-10-LABX-0001-01).

The process of recognizing diseases is often time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most of disease damage evaluation and treatment are done by farmers in the field with guidance of plant pathologists. Incorrect diagnosis and pesticide over usage are very common. Therefore, a timely and accurate recognition method of cucumber diseases is in great demand. Convolutional neural network is one of the most popular and best performing methods for image recognition. Because convolutional neural network has been extensively applied to agriculture applications, it is feasible to use convolutional neural network as the pattern recognition method for plant disease recognition. Convolutional neural network can automatically learn appropriate features from training datasets instead of manual feature extraction. The efforts on feature extraction and optimization can be saved. This not only reduces the computation cost, but also increases the accuracy and efficiency of the recognition. In this study, the state of the art convolutional neural network and deep learning techniques were applied to the recognition of cucumber diseases using visible leaf symptoms. A disease recognition system for greenhouse cucumbers based on convolutional neural network was presented in this paper based on deep learning and image processing. The key point of effective identification and diagnosis of diseases was to acquire the disease information accurately. With the development of computer vision technology, segmenting the disease symptom images from leaf images was presently considered as the main route of disease information acquisition. Color was the most direct information to discriminate disease symptoms from the other parts in a single image captured under real field conditions. Disease images captured under real field conditions were suffering from uneven illumination and complicated background, which was a big challenge to achieve robust disease symptom image segmentation. The symptom images were segmented by a novel image processing method using color information and region growing. Firstly, combinations of color features (CCF) and its detection method were presented. The combinations of color features consisted of three color components, excess red index (ExR), H component of HSV color space and B component of CIELAB color space, which implemented powerful discrimination of disease symptoms from clutter background. Then an interactive region growing method based on the comprehensive color feature map was used to achieve disease symptom image segmentation from clutter background. Input datasets was built from the symptom images. In order to decrease the chance of overfitting, data augmentation method that was to rotate the original datasets by 90, 160, 180 and 270 degrees and flip horizontally and vertically was utilized to enlarge the input datasets, which produced 12 augmented datasets. With the augmented input datasets, the system achieved good classification performance. Experiments were conducted to test the performance of the system. Results showed that the symptom image segmentation method can achieve an overall accuracy of 97.29%, which indicated that the method was capable of obtaining accurate and robust segmentation under real field conditions. The system achieved an overall accuracy of 95.7%, 93.1% for downy mildew and 98.4% for powdery mildew respectively, which indicated that the disease recognition system was capable of recognizing cucumber downy mildew and powdery mildew. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Therefore, increasing and improving the quality of the crop yield is a major field of interest. Recently, infectious biotic and abiotic diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Farmers worldwide deal with the issue of plant diseases diagnosis and their proper treatment. With advancements of technology in precision agriculture, there has been quite a few works done for plant diseases classification although, the performances of the existing approaches are not satisfactory. Moreover, most of the previous works fail to accurately segment leaf part from the whole image especially when an image has complex background. Thus, a computer vision approach is proposed in order to address these challenges. The proposed approach consists of two modules. The first module extracts leaf part from whole image by subtracting complex background. The second module introduces a deep learning convolution neural network (CNN), SoyNet, for soybean plant diseases recognition using segmented leaf images. All the experiments are done on “Image Database of Plant Disease Symptoms” having 16 categories. The proposed model achieves identification accuracy of 98.14% with good precision, recall and f1-score. The proposed method is also compared with three hand-crafted features based state-of-the-art methods and six popularly used deep learning CNN models namely, VGG19, GoogleLeNet, Dense121, XceptionNet, LeNet, and ResNet50. The obtained results depict that the proposed method outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods/models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Background separation; Convolution neural networks; Soybean leaf diseases identification","Glycine max; Agriculture; Complex networks; Convolution; Deep learning; Developing countries; Image segmentation; Background separation; Complex background; Convolution neural network; Developing world; Human population; Identification accuracy; Leaf disease; State-of-the-art methods; bacterial disease; computer vision; crop yield; developing world; disease transmission; experimental study; identification method; separation; soybean; Diagnosis","","","","","Jabalpur India, (SPARC-MHRD-231); PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing","This work is partially supported by the project “Prediction of diseases through computer assisted diagnosis system using images captured by minimally-invasive and non-invasive modalities”, Computer Science and Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur India (under ID: SPARC-MHRD-231).

Starting from 2015, many projects use Siamese networks and this kind of loss for face recognition and object classification. In our research, we focused on two tasks related to vegetation. The first one is plant disease detection on 25 classes of five crops (grape, cotton, wheat, cucumbers, and corn). This task is motivated because harvest losses due to diseases is a serious problem for both large farming structures and rural families. The second task is the identification of moss species (5 classes). Mosses are natural bioaccumulators of pollutants; therefore, they are used in environmental monitoring programs. The identification of moss species is an important step in the sample preprocessing. In both tasks, we used self-collected image databases. We tried several deep learning architectures and approaches. Our Siamese network architecture with a triplet loss function and MobileNetV2 as a base network showed the most impressive results in both above-mentioned tasks. The average accuracy for plant disease detection amounted to over 97.8 % and 97.6 % for moss species classification. © 2021, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

The main problem facing the automatic identification of plant diseases using this strategy is the lack of image databases capable of representing the wide variety of conditions and symptom characteristics found in practice. Data augmentation techniques decrease the impact of this problem, but those cannot reproduce most of the practical diversity. This paper explores the use of individual lesions and spots for the task, rather than considering the entire leaf. Since each region has its own characteristics, the variability of the data is increased without the need for additional images. This also allows the identification of multiple diseases affecting the same leaf. On the other hand, suitable symptom segmentation still needs to be done manually, preventing full automation. The accuracies obtained using this approach were, in average, 12% higher than those achieved using the original images. Additionally, no crop had accuracies below 75%, even when as many as 10 diseases were considered. Although the database does not cover the entire range of practical possibilities, these results indicate that, as long as enough data is available, deep learning techniques are effective for plant disease detection and recognition. © 2019 IAgrE","Deep neural nets; Disease classification; Image classification; Image processing; Transfer learning","Automation; Deep neural networks; Image processing; Automatic identification; Data augmentation; Deep neural nets; Disease classification; Image database; Learning techniques; Original images; Transfer learning; Image classification","","","","","Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária, EMBRAPA, (SEG 02.14.09.001.00.00)","The author would like to thank Embrapa ( SEG 02.14.09.001.00.00 ) for funding.

The occurrence of Camellia oleifera disease is affected by various factors, such as variety, cultivation environment, climate condition and management level. The key to effective prevention and cure of Camellia oleifera disease is to identify the disease type timely and accurately. Traditional computer vision methods for plant leaf disease recognition depend heavily on time-consuming and elaborate feature design. To solve this problem, a recognition model of Camellia olerfera leaf diseases based on convolutional neural network was proposed and transfer learning was used to improve model's performance. Deep convolutional neural network has powerful capacities of feature learning and feature expression, which was used to learn features of diseased Camellia oleifera leaves. Transfer learning method was used to transfer the knowledge learned from ImageNet dataset by AlexNet to the identification task of Camellia oleifera diseases. The proposed model was implemented with Python programming language under the deep learning framework of Tensorflow by modifying the output number of the last fully connected layers in AlexNet to 5. We collected Camellia oleifera leaves in artificial Camellia oleifera land and took photos by mobile phone in bright indoor environment after flattening leaves. Leaf images were first converted from RGB (red, green, blue) color space to HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) color space, and then background was removed by threshold segmentation on hue and saturation channels. After segmentation, morphological open and close operations with a radius of 3 pixels were performed to remove burrs, holes and other noises, and thus the leaf mask was obtained by filling holes. Leaf mask was multiplied with the original image to obtain the colored leaf region. The colored leaf region was then rotated according to its principal axis angle and aligned horizontally. Based on the long edge, leaf image was scaled to 256×256 pixels. After these pretreatments, Camellia oleifera leaf images were manually identified as algal spot, soft rot, sooty mould, yellows and healthy leaf. A total of 750 images for each disease category were selected to form data set, 80% of samples were randomly selected for train set, and the remaining 20% for test set. To simulate different views of image acquisition and reduce over-fitting of network models, image datasets of diseased Camellia oleifera leaf were augmented by random crop, random rotation and random perspective transformation. To save space for huge amount of augmented images, data augmentation was executed online when training. In random crop mode, image is randomly cropped from 256×256 to 227×227 pixels. In random rotation mode, image is randomly rotated by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. In order to avoid serious distortion of the transformed image, the displacement of the corresponding point in perspective transformation is limited to 10% of the image width and height. A total of 54 experiments were performed on Nvidia GPU with a combination of 2 learning methods (training from scratch, transfer learning), 3 data augmentation modes (no augmentation, random cropping, sequential execution of random cropping, perspective transformation and rotation), 3 regularization coefficients (0.0, 0.0005, 0.0001), and 3 initial learning rates (0.001, 0.005, 0.01). When training from scratch, weights are randomly initialized with truncated normal distribution and biases are initialized with zero constant. In transfer learning, only the last fully connected layers' weights and biases are reinitialized with random values, and those of other layers are assigned by the values from pre-trained AlexNet model. Experimental results show that transfer learning can significantly improve models' convergence speed and classification performance, and data augmentation can enrich data diversity and avoid over fitting especially when training from scratch. The classification accuracy was as high as 96.53% in transfer learning, and the F1 scores of algal spot, soft rot, sooty mould, yellows and healthy leaf achieved 94.28%, 94.67%, 97.31%, 98.34% and 98.03% respectively. This method has high recognition accuracy, and strong robustness to translation and rotation, and can provide references for intelligent diagnosis of plant leaf diseases. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Pest identification tends to consume a lot of labor, and it is difficult for naked eyes to quickly and accurately identify pest species. However, there still exist some drawbacks in the traditional deep learning algorithms for pest recognition, such as gradient explosion or gradient disappearance in deep neural networks, degradation and overfitting caused by limited sample size. In order to address these problems and improve the accuracy of pest recognition, a pest image recognition method based on improved residual network was proposed. Firstly, the pest images in the data set were converted to grayscale before edge detection was performed on them by using Rich-edge. To obtain a fine-lined pest image, the Rich-edge was combined with median filtering, Sobel operator and Canny operator to detect the edges of the pest images. Among them, the median filter effectively eliminated the salt and pepper noise, the Sobel operator accurately detected the position information, and the Canny operator detected the weak edge. The images after edge detection were quantized to be 224 pixel×224 pixel for training and classification. Then the obtained pest image set was used to train the deep neural network, which was a variant of standard residual network with additional convolution layers and channels for extracting more image features. And the dropout layer was added to each residual block of the network to prevent overfitting when it was trained on a relatively small data set. Besides, the regularization hyper parameters of the network were designed to be optimized by Bayesian method which adaptively adjusted the size of the hyper parameters with the adjustment of weights during network training. The weights of the proposed network were optimized through the Block-cg algorithm. In the optimization algorithm, the block diagonal was used to approximate the curvature matrix, which improved the convergence of the Hessian matrix; and independent conjugate gradient update was conducted for each sub-block, which divided the whole issue into certain number of sub-problems and reduced the complexity of local search. Eventually the values of the weights were not updated until an ideal pest classification accuracy rate was obtained. To verify the validity and robustness of the proposed method, an image data set of 38 common garden pests in north of China was collected and experiments were carried out on this data set. Experimental results empirically demonstrated that compared with the three traditional pest recognition methods for the same data set, the proposed method could make the recognition accuracy increase by 9.6 percentage points on average and the weighted average score increase by 16.3 percentage points, 10.8 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

There are large numbers of plant species in the world. Plant species plays a vital role in many domains such as preventing some of the diseases, farming, environment, discovery of new drug and other related areas. Recognition of plant species without expert understanding is a huge task. There has been great demand for applying automatic computer vision technologies to increase botanical knowledge. Using leaf features and traits, the classification and identification of plant is carried out. Leaf features like shape, texture and venation are the features most frequently used to differentiate the plant species. Different methodologies are there to extract the feature and to classify the leaf images using a classifier. In this paper we are going to discuss on different leaf recognition approaches along with feature extraction methods and their performances. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

In traditional practices, identification is performed either by visual observation or by testing in laboratory. The visual observation requires expertise and it may vary subject to an individual which may lead to an error while the laboratory test is time consuming and may not be able to provide the results in time. To overcome these issues, image based machine learning approach to detect and classify plant diseases has been presented in literature. We have focused specifically on rice plant (Oryza sativa) disease in this paper. The images of the diseased symptoms in leaves and stems have been captured from the rice field. We have collected a total of 619 rice plant diseased images from the real field condition belong to four classes: (a) Rice Blast (RB), (b) Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB), (c) Sheat Blight (SB) and (d) Healthy Leave (HL). We have used a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We have obtained encouraging results. The early identification of rice diseases by this approach could be used as a preventive measure well as an early warning system. Further, it could be extended to develop a rice plant disease identification system on real agriculture field. © Authors 2019.

In this work, an improved model based on VGG16 is proposed to identify apple leaf diseases, in which the global average poling layer is used to replace the fully connected layer to reduce the parameters and a batch normalization layer is added to improve the convergence speed. A transfer learning strategy is used to avoid a long training time. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of apple leaf classification based on the proposed model can reach 99.01%. Compared with the classical VGG16, the model parameters are reduced by 89%, the recognition accuracy is improved by 6.3%, and the training time is reduced to 0.56% of that of the original model. Therefore, the deep convolutional neural network model proposed in this work provides a better solution for the identification of apple leaf diseases with higher accuracy and a faster convergence speed. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to solve the problem, a structured model compression method was studied in this research. Its core idea was using knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge from the complex integrated model to a lightweight small-scale neural network. Firstly, VGG16 was used to train a teacher model with a higher recognition rate, whose volume was much larger than the student model. Then the knowledge in the model was transfered to MobileNet by using distillation. The parameters number of the VGG16 model was greatly reduced. The knowledge-distilled model was named Distilled-MobileNet, and was applied to the classification task of 38 common diseases (powdery mildew, Huanglong disease, etc.) of 14 crops (soybean, cucumber, tomato, etc.). The performance test of knowledge distillation on four different network structures of VGG16, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet showed that when VGG16 was used as a teacher model, the accuracy of the model was improved to 97.54%. Using single disease recognition rate, average accuracy rate, model memory and average recognition time as 4 indicators to evaluate the accuracy of the trained Distilled-MobileNet model in a real environment, the results showed that, the average accuracy of the model reached 97.62%, and the average recognition time was shortened to 0.218 s, only accounts for 13.20% of the VGG16 model, and the model size was reduced to only 19.83 MB, which was 93.60% smaller than VGG16. Compared with traditional neural networks, distilled-mobile model has a significant improvement in reducing size and shorting recognition time, and can provide a new idea for disease recognition on devices with limited memory and computing resources. © Smart Agriculture 2021.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease identification; Knowledge distillation; Model compression","","","","","","","","KAMILARIS A, PRENAFETA-BOLDU F X., A review of the use of convolutional neural networks in agriculture [ J], The Journal of Agricultural Science, 156, 3, pp. 312-322, (2018); KARLEKAR A, SEAL A., SoyNet: Soybean leaf diseases classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 172, (2020); TETILA E C, MACHADO B B, MENEZES G K, Et al., Automatic recognition of soybean leaf diseases Using UAV images and deep convolutional neural networks [ J], IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 17, 5, pp. 903-907, (2019); ADEEL A, KHAN M A, AKRAM T, Et al., Entropy controlled deep features selection framework for grape leaf diseases recognition, Expert Systems, 1, (2020); ZHANG X, QIAO Y, MENG F, Et al., Identification of maize leaf diseases using improved deep convolutional neural networks [J], IEEE Access, 6, pp. 30370-30377, (2018); CHEN G, ZHAO S, CAO L, Et al., Corn plant disease recognition based on migration learning and convolutional neural network [J], Smart Agriculture, 1, 2, pp. 34-44, (2019); WU H., Method of tomato leaf diseases recognition method based on deep residual network, Smart Agriculture, 1, 4, pp. 42-49, (2019); LEI X, YIN Z, ZHAO R., FPGA-based convolutional neural network fixed-point acceleration, Computer Applications, 40, 10, pp. 2811-2816, (2020); HAN R, LIU C, LI S, Et al., Accelerating deep learning systems via critical set identification and model compression [ J], IEEE Transactions on Computers, 69, 7, pp. 1059-1070, (2020); RAHMAN C R, ARKO P S, ALI M E, Et al., Identification and recognition of rice diseases and pests using convolutional neural networks [EB/OL]; SHIH K H, CHIU C, LIN J A, Et al., Real-time object detection with reduced region proposal network via multi-feature concatenation, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 31, pp. 2164-2173, (2020); HC A, YL A, KCY B, Et al., Block change learning for knowledge distillation, Information Sciences, 513, pp. 360-371, (2020); WU M, CHIU C, WU K., Multi-teacher knowledge distillation for compressed video action recognition based on deep learning, ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), (2019); HUGHES D P, SALATHE M., An open access repository of images on plant health to enable the development of mobile disease diagnostics, (2015); HINTON G, VINYALS O, DEAN J., Distilling the knowledge in a neural network [EB/OL], Computer Science, (2015); SHORTEN C, KHOSHGOFTAAR T M., A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); RADFORD A, METZ L, CHINTALA S., Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, (2015); WENG L, PRENEEL B., A secure perceptual hash algorithm for image content authentication, 12th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 International Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security, pp. 108-121, (2011); PAN S J, YANG Q., A survey on transfer learning, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 22, 10, pp. 1345-1359, (2009); HOWARD A G, ZHU M, CHEN B, Et al., MobileNets: Efficient convolutional neural networks for mobile vision applications, (2017); KAILATH T., The divergence and Bhattacharyya distance measures in signal selection, IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology, 15, 1, pp. 52-60, (1967); ASHOK A, RHINEHART N, BEAINY F, Et al., N2N learning: Network to network compression via policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning, 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018, (2018); CHEBOTAR Y, WATERS A., Distilling knowledge from ensembles of neural networks for speech recognition, Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, pp. 3439-3433, (2016)","J.

The application of computer vision technology based on deep learning models in crop disease identification has incomparable advantages over traditional artificial diagnosis and recognition methods and improves the ability of crop disease monitoring and early prediction. On the other hand, training the models requires a large amount of data, but most of the crop leaf diseases image data are insufficient or unbalanced, which results in a great limitation of performance for various tasks. To solve the data imbalance problem, the application of augmentation methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) is proposed. In this paper, we present a data augmentation method using conditional GL-GAN(GL-CGAN) based on adaptive global and local bilevel optimization model(GL-GAN) and Auxiliary Classifier GANs(ACGAN). We first train the model based on the Plant Village dataset and then employ it to the expanded image datasets. By adding the synthetic data the accuracy of the classifier is higher than the models which are trained only on the original dataset  © 2021 IEEE.","Data enhancement; Generative Adversarial Networks; GL-GAN; Imbalance data; Leaf diseases detection","Classification (of information); Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Augmentation methods; Crop disease; Crop leaves; Crop quality; Data augmentation; Data enhancement; GL-generative adversarial network; Imbalance datum; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Generative adversarial networks","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2662019TYJ003, 2662021JC008, N0.2018YFC1604000)","This work was primarily support?d by National K?y R&D Program of China (N0.2018YFC1604000) and Fundam?ntal R?s?arch Funds for th?

All these species contribute to biodiversity, provide clean and fresh air, prevent soil erosion, home remedy, and many more. Acquiring knowledge about species is essential for protecting biodiversity. The identification of plants by conventional methods is complex and time-consuming for novices. Also, many species are endangered because of human encroachment and due to diseases affecting plants. These plant diseases cause economic, social, and ecological losses. In this context, diagnosing diseases accurately and timely and doing the necessary control measures is of the utmost importance. There have been many technological advancements in the area of computer vision to identify plant species and diseases automatically.

In this work, the focus was on fine-tuning and evaluation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network for image-based plant disease classification. An empirical comparison of the deep learning architecture is done. The architectures evaluated include VGG 16, Inception V4, ResNet with 50, 101 and 152 layers and DenseNets with 121 layers. The data used for the experiment is 38 different classes including diseased and healthy images of leafs of 14 plants from plantVillage. Fast and accurate models for plant disease identification are desired so that accurate measures can be applied early. Thus, alleviating the problem of food security. In our experiment, DenseNets has tendency's to consistently improve in accuracy with growing number of epochs, with no signs of overfitting and performance deterioration. Moreover, DenseNets requires a considerably less number of parameters and reasonable computing time to achieve state-of-the-art performances. It achieves a testing accuracy score of 99.75% to beat the rest of the architectures.

Many cultures are subject to them. The disease is difficult to control on a large scale, so one of the most relevant approaches is crop monitoring, which helps to identify the disease at an early stage and make efforts to prevent its spread. One of the most effective methods of control is the identification of the disease from digital images that obtained by a smartphone camera. In this paper, we present a deep learning algorithm that uses a digital image of wheat plants to determine whether they are affected by a disease and, if so, what type: leaf rust or stem rust. The algorithm based on the convolution neural network of the densenet architecture. The resulting model demonstrates high accuracy of classification: the measure of accuracy F1 on the validation sample is 0.9, the AUC averaged over 3 classes is 0.98. © 2020 IEEE.","CNN; deep learning; image analysis; leaf rust; phenotyping; stem rust; wheat","Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Disease control; Fungi; Image processing; Image recognition; Learning algorithms; Convolution neural network; Crop monitoring; Digital image; High-accuracy; Pathogenic fungi; Plant productivity; Smart-phone cameras; Wheat plants; Neural networks","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (17-29-08028); Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ","The work supported by RFBR grant 17-29-08028.

Plants have an important place in the life of all living things. Today, there is a risk of extinction for many plant species due to climate change and its environmental impact. Therefore, researchers have conducted various studies with the aim of protecting the diversity of the planet's plant life. Generally, research in this area is aimed at determining plant species and diseases, with works predominantly based on plant images. Advances in deep learning techniques have provided very successful results in this field, and have become widely used in research studies to identify plant species. Methods. In this paper, a Multi-Division Convolutional Neural Network (MD-CNN)- based plant recognition system was developed in order to address an agricultural problem related to the classification of plant species. In the proposed system, we divide plant images into equal nxn-sized pieces, and then deep features are extracted for each piece using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For each part of the obtained deep features, effective features are selected using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. Finally, the obtained effective features are combined and classification conducted using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Results. In order to test the performance of the proposed deep-based system, eight different plant datasets were used: Flavia, Swedish, ICL, Foliage, Folio, Flower17, Flower102, and LeafSnap. According to the results of these experimental studies, 100% accuracy scores were achieved for the Flavia, Swedish, and Folio datasets, whilst the ICL, Foliage, Flower17, Flower102, and LeafSnap datasets achieved results of 99.77%, 99.93%, 97.87%, 98.03%, and 94.38%, respectively.

India is the second-largest producer of agricultural products globally. There are plenty of problems that a farmer faces in their field of work. When plants and crops are affected by pests, weeds, heat stress, cold stress, soil salinity, and acidity stress, drought, and flood, it affects the country's agricultural production. Usually, farmers observe the plants by their eye for detection and identification of disease. But this method can be time processing, expensive, human resources and inaccurate, etc. This proposed work is concerned with a new approach to detect the tomato plant diseases recognition model based on leaf image classification using the deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method. Automatic detection using image processing with deep learning techniques provides fast and accurate results. This technology helps the farmer identify what type of diseases the plant is being affected and suggests some medicine to be given to the affected plant. CNN techniques classified a few types of tomato diseases such as septoria leaf spot, leaf mold, bacterial spot, early blight, late blight are trained and fine-tuned to fit accurately into a plant's leaves gathered independently for diverse plant diseases. Disease severity is estimated using the dataset of infected leaf samples and output images to show the three types of severity level stages are low, medium or high levels in the MATLAB software. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2021.","CNN; Disease detection; Feature extraction; MATLAB; Severity estimation and deep learning; Tomato leaf","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Fruits; Image processing; Plants (botany); Cold stress; Convolutional neural network; Disease classification; Disease detection; Features extraction; Heat stress; Leaf disease detections; Plant disease; Severity estimation and deep learning; Tomato leaf; MATLAB","","","","","","","Nagi Reva, Tripathy Sanjaya Shankar, Infected Area Segmentation and Severity Estimation of Grapevine Using Fuzzy Logic, (2020); Trivedi Jay, Shamnani Yash, Gajjar Ruchi, Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning, International Conference on Emerging Technology Trends in Electronics Communication and Networking, (2020); Krishnakumar Anakha, Narayanan Athi, A System for Plant Disease Classification and Severity Estimation Using Machine Learning Techniques, (2019); Sibiya Malusi, Sumbwanyambe Mbuyu, An Algorithm for Severity Estimation of Plant Leaf Diseases by the Use of Colour Threshold Image Segmentation and Fuzzy Logic Inference: A Proposed Algorithm to Update a “Leaf Doctor, (2019); Esgarioa Jose G.M., Krohlinga Renato A., Venturad Jose A., Deep learning for classification and severity estimation of coffee leaf biotic stress, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, (2019); Prajwala TM, Pranathi Alla, Ashritha Kandiraju Sai, Nagaratna B, Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks, Eleventh International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), (2018); Elhassouny Azeddine, Smarandache Florentin, Smart mobile application to recognize tomato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE/ICCSRE2019, (2019); Anjnaa Meenakshi Sooda, Singh Pradeep Kumar, Hybrid System for Detection and Classification of Plant Disease Using Qualitative Texture Features Analysis, International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Data Science (ICCIDS), (2019); Prajwala TM, Pranathi Alla, Ashritha Kandiraju Sai, Chittaragi Nagaratna B., Koolagudi Shashidhar G., Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks, (2018); Kumar Akshay, Vani M, Image Based Tomato Leaf Disease Detection, (2018)","","","Grenze Scientific Society","","12th International Conference on Advances in Computing, Control, and Telecommunication Technologies, ACT 2021","27 August 2021 through 28 August 2021","Hyderabad, Virtual","172116","","","","","English","Int.

Recent developments in deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) have greatly improved image classification accuracy. Being motivated by the success of CNNs in image classification, deep learning-based approaches have been developed in this paper for detecting diseases and pests from rice plant images. The contribution of this paper is two fold: (i) State-of-the-art large scale architectures such as VGG16 and InceptionV3 have been adopted and fine tuned for detecting and recognising rice diseases and pests. Experimental results show the effectiveness of these models with real datasets. (ii) Since large scale architectures are not suitable for mobile devices, a two-stage small CNN architecture has been proposed, and compared with the state-of-the-art memory efficient CNN architectures such as MobileNet, NasNet Mobile and SqueezeNet. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture can achieve the desired accuracy of 93.3% with a significantly reduced model size (e.g., 99% smaller than VGG16). © 2020 IAgrE","Convolutional neural network; Dataset; Memory efficient; Pest; Rice disease; Two stage training","Convolution; Deep learning; Image classification; Image enhancement; Losses; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Classification accuracy; Dataset; Learning-based approach; Memory efficient; Pest; Proposed architectures; Real data sets; State of the art; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Bangladesh ICT; RMIT University, RMIT; Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, BRRI","We thank Bangladesh ICT division for funding this research.

Plant pathogens will affect its leaves at a certain time during crop cultivation, leading to substantial harm to crop productivity & economic selling price. In the agriculture industry, the identification of fungal diseases plays a vital role. However, it requires immense labor, greater planning time, and extensive knowledge of plant pathogens. Computerized approaches are developed and tested by different researchers to classify plant disease identification, and that in many cases they have also had important results several times. Therefore, the proposed study presents a new framework for the recognition of fruits and vegetable diseases. This work comprises of the two phases wherein the phase-I improved localization model is presented that comprises of the two different types of the deep learning models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO)v2 and Open Exchange Neural (ONNX) model. The localization model is constructed by the combination of the deep features that are extracted from the ONNX model and features learning has been done through the convolutional-05 layer and transferred as input to the YOLOv2 model. The localized images passed as input to classify the different types of plant diseases. The classification model is constructed by ensembling the deep features learning, where features are extracted dimension of 1 × 1000 from pre-trained Efficientnetb0 model and supplied to next 07 layers of the convolutional neural network such as 01 features input, 01 ReLU, 01 Batch-normalization, 02 fully-connected. The proposed model classifies the plant input images into associated labels with approximately 95% prediction scores that are far better as compared to current published work in this domain. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Traditional monitoring methods rely mainly on field sampling, and thereby to assess the species and severity of diseases, normally implemented by plant conservation experts. Nevertheless, the time-consuming and laborious method cannot meet the application requirements of rapid detection in actual large-scale production in modern agriculture. Alternatively, the image analysis method for automatic identification of plant diseases can provide an effective technical way for the real-time monitoring, particularly on deep learning algorithms with the advantages of high spatial resolution and high speed. However, most previous methods strongly depend on the experience of experts during the design of deep neural network architectures. It is inevitable to frequently adjust the network architecture and parameters, in order to obtain the optimal recognition model. In this study, a disease recognition method from plant leaf image was proposed based on the Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm was used to guide the network morphism, and thereby the network architecture can be selected as the optimal operation of network morphism every time. The proposed method can also automatically learn the appropriate deep neural network architecture according to the specific data set. A total of 54 306 plant disease images including 14 crops and 26 diseases of PlantVillage were used as experimental data. The balanced data after oversampling and subsampling, and the data after grayscale processing, where the 80% of images were used as the training dataset, whereas, the rest as the testing dataset. Firstly, the initial architecture of NAS was set as a three-layer convolutional neural network. Each layer was set as a convolution block, including a ReLU layer, a batch-normalization layer, a convolutional layer, and a pooling layer. Training data was used as the NAS input, while, the search history can be all generated network architecture, parameters learned from network architecture, and model loss values. Secondly, the acquisition function algorithm was optimized to generate the next network architecture for the observation. In the algorithm, the input data can be taken as the minimum temperature, cooling rate and search history of simulated annealing algorithm, whereas, the output data can be the new network architecture, and the required network morphing operation, in order to transform the existing architecture into a new one. After that, it needed to divide the data into multiple batches, and then to train each searched neural architecture. The optimal network architecture was automatically marked when the given search time reached. As such, the required network architecture was finally trained to obtain the disease classification model. Consequently, the disease identification can be gained using the test data as input to the model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can search the appropriate network architecture in a short time. Furthermore, the method can also find out the optimal network structure, when the training sample data was in unbalanced and balanced conditions, where the accuracies of model recognition were 98.96% and 99.01%, respectively. Additionally, the color information of images related to plant disease has a positive promoting effect on the recognition of the diseases. Nevertheless, the accuracy of model recognition relatively decreased to 95.40%, when the gray image without balance processing was used as the training data. The proposed method can effectively simplify the workload of network architecture design, while identify accurately plant diseases, and thereby to provide a promising technical way for scientific formulation of disease control strategies. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The latest advancements in connectivity, automation, and artificial intelligence enable farmers better to monitor all procedures and apply precise treatments determined by machines with superhuman accuracy. Farmers, data scientists and, engineers continue to work on techniques that allow optimizing the human labor required in farming. With valuable information resources improving day by day, smart farming turns into a learning system and becomes even smarter. Deep learning is a type of machine learning method, using artificial neural network principles. The main feature by which deep learning networks are distinguished from neural networks is their depth and that feature makes them capable of discovering latent structures within unlabeled, unstructured data. Deep learning networks that do not need human intervention while performing automatic feature extraction have a significant advantage over previous algorithms.

In this work, we present a robust image-based Plant Disease Diagnosis and Severity Estimation Network (PD                             2                             SE-Net), which contains a residual structure and shuffle units. The aim of this paper is to design a more excellent and practical diagnosis system for plant diseases. The common plant disease diagnosis, disease severity estimation, are simultaneously addressed by the proposed PD                             2                             SE-Net. In addition, the data augmentation and visualization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are exploited in this paper to improve the accuracy and accelerate the excellent selection of hyper-parameters during the training period. To the best of our knowledge, this report for the first time describes a computer-assisted approach that can simultaneously estimate disease severity, recognize species, and classify disease for plants base on deep learning. The proposed PD                             2                             SE-Net50 consists of the ResNet50 architecture as the basic model and shuffle units as the auxiliary structures, and it achieves excellent comprehensive performances (overall accuracies of 0.91, 0.99 and 0.98 for the disease severity estimation, plant species recognition and plant disease classification, respectively) over the existing approaches. As a diagnosis expert, our system exploits the multivariate nature of plant leaves in order to deliver an outstanding classification performance with a low computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our network.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CNNs; Plant disease diagnosis; Residual structure; Severity estimation; Shuffle units","Computer aided instruction; Data visualization; Deep learning; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Classification performance; CNNs; Comprehensive performance; Computational costs; Convolutional neural network; Plant disease diagnosis; Residual structure; Shuffle units; computer simulation; disease incidence; disease severity; host plant; identification method; training; visualization; Computer aided diagnosis","","","","","Chang-Zhu-Tan National Indigenous Innovation Demonstration Zone Project, (2017XK2102); National Nature Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, (61673163); National Natural Science Foundation of China; Changzhou Key Laboratory of Special Robot and Intelligent Technology, (IRT2018003); Changzhou Key Laboratory of Special Robot and Intelligent Technology","This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China ( NSFC 61673163 ), Chang-Zhu-Tan National Indigenous Innovation Demonstration Zone Project ( 2017XK2102 ), and Hunan Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robot Technology in Electronic Manufacturing ( IRT2018003 ).

Farmers or specialists usually observe naked-eye plants for disease detection and identification. But time-consuming, costly and incorrect may be this technique. Adequate and accurate findings are achieved using image processing methods. The main emphasis in this paper is on identifying plant diseases and reducing crop loss, therefore increasing the efficiency of production. Our suggested study identifies the symptoms of plants at a very early stage and uses a Deep Learning (DL) method to classify the plants' diseases based on their symptoms. This method adds to the conventional AlexNet the deconvolution layer to decrease the percentage of parameters and the cost of computation, classifying images with a fully connected layer. This research article presents a technique based on improved AlexNet for classification of plants.

Aiming at the problem of high cost and low efficiency of traditional detection of pearl millet mildew disease, a method based on transfer learning was proposed to identify the problem of pearl millet downy mildew in convolutional neural network. Using a digital camera and mobile phone to photograph the pearl millet, an image of pearl millet disease was obtained, and the PlantVillage dataset was used to expand the data. Then, 4,700 images of leaves and inflorescences were obtained by hand marking. The pretrained AlexNet and InceptionV3 models were fine-tuned, retaining all convolutional layer parameters of the pretrained models, replacing the fully connected layer with the Softmax classifier, and then transfer learning was performed on the pearl millet dataset.

However, the same category of diseases and insect pests showed obvious differences in intra-class representation and slight similarities in inter-class representation of various diseases, due to the influence of environmental conditions, disease cycle and damaged tissues. At present, the traditional deep transfer learning methods have been difficult to cope with large-scale, multi-class fine-grained identification of pests and diseases, particularly unsuitable to the practice in complicated scenes. This paper aims to apply multiple source cameras in agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) and different intelligent precision equipment, including picking robots and smart phones, to capture high resolution 122,000 images of insect pests and diseases, covering a total of 181 fine-grained categories, including 49 types pests and 77 types diseases on different plant parts of different crops. A fine-grained recognition model was then proposed for pests and diseases based on the Multi-Stream Gaussian Probability Fusion Network (MPFN). In detail, a data-augmented method was first employed to enlarge the dataset, and then to pretrain the basic VGG19 and ResNet networks on high-quality images, in order to learn common and domain knowledge, as well fine-tuning with professional skill. Next, the refined multiple deep learning networks, including Fast-MPN and NTS-Net with transfer learning, were applied to design a multi-stream feature extractor, utilizing the mixture-granularity information to exploit high-dimensionality features, thereby to distinguish interclass discrepancy and tolerate intra-class variances. Finally, an integrated optimization was developed combining the NetVLAD feature aggregation layer with the gaussian probability fusion layer, in order to fuse various components model with Gaussian distribution as a unified probability representation for the ultimate fine-grained recognition. The input of this module was the various features of multi-models, whereas, the output was the fused classification probability. The end-to-end implementation of framework included an inner loop about the expectation maximization algorithm within an outer loop with the gradient back-propagation optimization of the whole network, indicating multi-model fusion information complementation and confidence for the overall model. The experimental results demonstrated that the MPFN model presented the excellent performance in the average recognition accuracy rate of 93.18% for a total of 181 classes of pests and diseases, indicating 5.6 percentage points better than that of the coarse-grained and fine-grained deep learning methods. In terms of test time, the average processing time of the MPFN was 61ms, indicating the basic needs of fine-grained image recognition of pests and diseases at the terminals of the IoT and intelligent equipment. In the contradistinctive analysis, training loss curves and various sub-categories identification showed that the feature aggregation fusion and Gaussian probability fusion can greatly enhance the efficiency of model with the training speed, recognition accuracy and generalized robustness for fine-grained identification of crop pests and diseases in practical scenarios. Therefore, this work can provide a technical application reference for the intelligent recognition of pests and diseases in agricultural production. In the follow-up study, more images will be taken under natural conditions to develop a more robust MPFN model deployed on actual IoTs or equipment for the pre-warning, prevention, and control of crop pests and diseases in modern agriculture. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The recognition of the tomato leaf disease at an early stage protects the tomato crops from getting affected. In the present generation, the emerging deep learning techniques Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) has manifested significant progress in image classification, image identification, and Sequence Predictions. Thus by using these computer vision-based deep learning techniques, we developed a new method for automatic leaf disease detection. This proposed model is a robust technique for tomato leaf disease identification that gives accurate and better results than other traditional methods. Early tomato leaf disease detection is made possible by using the hybrid CNN-RNN architecture which utilizes less computational effort.
